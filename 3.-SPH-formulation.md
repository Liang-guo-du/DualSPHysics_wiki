Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian meshless method. The
technique discretises a continuum using a set of material points or particles. When used
for the simulation of fluid dynamics, the discretised Navier-Stokes equations are locally
integrated at the location of each of these particles, according to the physical properties
of surrounding particles. The set of neighbouring particles is determined by a distance
based function, either circular (two-dimensional) or spherical (three-dimensional), with
an associated characteristic length or smoothing length often denoted as _h_. At each timestep
new physical quantities are calculated for each particle, and they then move
according to the updated values.

The conservation laws of continuum fluid dynamics are transformed from their partial
differential form to a form suitable for particle based simulation using integral equations
based on an interpolation function, which gives an estimate of values at a specific point.

Typically this interpolation or weighting function is referred to as the kernel function
(_W_) and can take different forms, with the most common being cubic or quintic. In all
cases however, it is designed to represent a function _F_(**r**) defined in **r**' by the integral
approximation

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4e3Yt3G.png"/> (1)
</p>

The smoothing kernel must fulfil several properties [Monaghan, 1992; Liu, 2003], such
as positivity inside a defined zone of interaction, compact support, normalization and
monotonically decreasing value with distance and differentiability. For a more complete
description of SPH, the reader is referred to [Monaghan, 2005; Violeau, 2013].

The function _F_ in Eq. (1) can be approximated in a non-continuous, discrete form based
on the set of particles. In this case the function is interpolated at a particle (_a_) where a
summation is performed over all the particles that fall within its region of compact
support, as defined by the smoothing length _h_

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IdTUGJG.png"/> (2)
</p>

where the subscript denotes an individual particle, _v_<sub>_b_</sub> is the volume of a neighbouring particle (_b_). If 
_v_<sub>_b_</sub>=_m_<sub>_b_</sub>/_ρ_<sub>_b_</sub>, with _m_ and _ρ_ being the mass and the density of particle _b_ respectively then Eq. (2) becomes

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rqu0cyp.png"/> (3)
</p>

## 3.1 Smoothing kernel

The performance of an SPH model depends heavily on the choice of the smoothing kernel. Kernels are expressed as a function of the non-dimensional distance between particles (_q_), given by _q_=_r_/_h_ , where _r_ is the distance between any two given particles a and b and the parameter _h_ (the smoothing length) controls the size of the area around particle a in which neighbouring particles are considered. Within DualSPHysics, the user is able to choose from one of the following kernel definitions:

1. Cubic Spline [Monaghan and Lattanzio, 1985]
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jyEuS6x.png"/> (4)
</p>

where α<sub>D</sub> is equal to 10/7πh<sup>2</sup> in 2-D and 1/πh<sup>3</sup> in 3-D.

The tensile correction method, proposed by [Monaghan, 2000], is only actively used in
the cases of a kernel whose first derivative goes to zero with the particle distance q.

2. Quintic [Wendland, 1995]
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/g0lkaup.png"/> (5)
</p>
where α<sub>D</sub> is equal to 7/4πh<sup>2</sup> in 2-D and 21/16πh</sup>3</sup> in 3-D.


In the text that follows, only kernels with an influence domain of 2 _h_ are
considered.

## 3.2 Momentum Equation
The momentum conservation equation in a continuum is

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5tlgjt0.png"/> (6)
</p>

where **_Γ_** refers to dissipative terms and **_g_** is gravitational acceleration. DualSPHysics
offers different options for including the effects of dissipation.

### 3.2.1 Artificial Viscosity
The artificial viscosity scheme, proposed by [Monaghan, 1992], is a common method
within fluid simulation using SPH due primarily to its simplicity. In SPH notation, Eq. 6
can be written as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6MwDAHJ.png"/> (7)
</p>

where P<sub>k</sub> and ρ<sub>k</sub> are the pressure and density that correspond to particle k (as evaluated
at a or b). The viscosity term <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jIBQoNg.png" /> is given by

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PNAdFht.png"/> (8)
</p>

where ab <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TBytuDT.png" /> and <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TBytuDT.png" /> with rk and vk being the particle position and velocity respectively. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0WtDphK.png" /> is the mean speed of sound, <img src="https://i.imgur.com/z8fQyJ8.png"/> and α is a coefficient that needs to be tuned in order to introduce the proper dissipation. The value of α=0.01 has proven to give the best results in the
validation of wave flumes to study wave propagation and wave loadings exerted onto
coastal structures [Altomare et al. (2015a)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2014.11.001).

### 3.2.2 Laminar viscosity and Sub-Particle Scale (SPS) Turbulence
Laminar viscous stresses in the momentum equation can be expressed as [Lo and Shao,
2002]

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P7BXWYL.png"/> (9)
</p>

where υo is kinematic viscosity (typically 10^(-6) for water). In SPH discrete notation
this can be expressed as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UhXKZwz.png"/> (10)
</p>

The concept of the Sub-Particle Scale (SPS) was first described by [Gotoh et al., 2001]
to represent the effects of turbulence in their Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS)
model. The momentum conservation equation is defined as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PrCkxCv.png"/> (11)
</p>

where the laminar term is treated as per Eq. 9 and <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GCGmUXz.png" /> represents the SPS stress tensor. Favre-averaging is needed to account for compressibility in weakly compressible SPH
[Dalrymple and Rogers, 2006] where eddy viscosity assumption is used to model the
SPS stress tensor with Einstein notation for the shear stress component in coordinate
directions i and j <img src="https://i.imgur.com/z7vOxa2.png" /> where <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ijsxbkq.png" /> is the sub-particle stress
tensor, <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cETvBL8.png" /> the turbulent eddy viscosity, k the SPS turbulence kinetic
energy, Cs the Smagorinsky constant (0.12), CI=0.0066, <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HS6vhQh.png" /> the particle to particle spacing and <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OtlzhLP.png" /> where <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CaDoLwa.png" /> is an element of the SPS strain tensor. [Dalrymple and Rogers, 2006] introduced SPS into weakly compressible SPH using Favre averaging, Eq.11 can be re-written as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RUG9SJF.png"/> (12)
</p>

## 3.3 Continuity equation
Throughout the duration of a weakly-compressible SPH simulation (as presented
herein) the mass of each particle remains constant and only their associated density
fluctuates. These density changes are computed by solving the conservation of mass, or
continuity equation, in SPH form:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CTsBQPl.png"/> (13)       
</p>

## 3.4 Equation of state
Following the work of [Monaghan, 1994], the fluid in the SPH formalism defined in
DualSPHysics is treated as weakly compressible and an equation of state is used to
determine fluid pressure based on particle density. The compressibility is adjusted so that
the speed of sound can be artificially lowered; this means that the size of time step taken
at any one moment (which is determined according to a Courant condition, based on the
currently calculated speed of sound for all particles) can be maintained at a reasonable
value. Such adjustment however, restricts the sound speed to be at least ten times faster
than the maximum fluid velocity, keeping density variations to within less than 1%, and
therefore not introducing major deviations from an incompressible approach. Following
[Monaghan et al., 1999] and [Batchelor, 1974], the relationship between pressure and
density follows the expression

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zbT9A4G.png"/> (14)
</p>

where <img src="https://i.imgur.com/noiD8EZ.png" /> where <img src="https://i.imgur.com/b9ppfL9.png" /> is the reference density and <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xDA7oho.png" /> which is the speed of sound at the reference density.

## 3.5 Density diffusion term
Within DualSPHysics it is also possible to apply a density diffusion term, that
introduces a diffusive term to reduce density fluctuations. The state equation describes a
very stiff density field, and together with the natural disordering of the
particles, high-frequency low amplitude oscillations are found to populate the density
scalar field. DualSPHysics uses a diffusive term in the
continuity equation, now written as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mRVNwfw.png"/> (15.1)      
</p>

with,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/p6J9R8x.png"/> (15.2)   
</p>

This represents the density diffusion formulation by [Molteni and Colagrossi, 2009],
with a free parameter that needs to be attributed a suitable value. This modification
can be explained as the addition of the Laplacian of the density field to the continuity
equation. [Antuono et al., 2012] has presented a careful analysis of the influence of this
term in the system, by decomposing the Laplacian operator, observing the converge of
the operators and performing linear stability analysis to inspect the influence of the
diffusive coefficient. This equation represents exactly a diffusive term in the domain
bulk. The behaviour changes close to open boundaries such as free-surface. Due to
truncation of the kernel (there are no particles being sampled outside of an open
boundary), the first-order contributions are not null [Antuono et al., 2010], resulting in a
net force applied to the particles. This effect is not considered relevant for nonhydrostatic
situations, where this force is many orders of magnitude inferior to any
other force involved. Corrections to this effect were proposed by [Antuono et al., 2010],
but involve the solution of a renormalization problem for the density gradient, with
considerable computational cost. A (_δ_<sub>_Φ_</sub>) coefficient of 0.1 is recommended
for most applications.

The work of [Fourtakas et al., 2020] introduces a correction in Eq. (15.2). The key idea is to use the same formulation proposed by [Molteni and Colagrossi, 2009] but substituting the dynamic density with the total one. Thus, the term _ψ_<sub>_ab_</sub> takes the following form,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sBfTPgw.png"/> (16)  
</p>

where the superscript _D_ denotes the dynamic density or pressure. Since _ρ_<sub>_D_</sub>=_ρ_<sub>_T_</sub>-_ρ_<sub>_H_</sub> (where superscript _T_ and _H_ denote the total and hydrostatic component, respectively), Eq. (16) can be rewritten in term of the hydrostatic and total parts as, 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ndN6ySn.png"/> (17)  
</p>

In the context of the weakly compressible SPH, the equation of state relates the density to the total pressure at the particle location. However, only the hydrostatic part of the pressure is needed. Using the equation of state (EOS), the hydrostatic density difference can be obtained by,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GaMbfSg.png"/> (18) 
</p>

The term _P_<sup>_H_</sup> is simply the hydrostatic pressure difference of particle _a_ and _b_,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m2UHAnl.png"/> (19) 
</p>

where _z_<sub>_ab_</sub> is the vertical distance between particle _a_ and _b_ and

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SPKMCml.png"/> (20)   
</p>

In comparison with the formulation of the diffusive term proposed by [Molteni and Colagrossi, 2009] of Eq. (15.2), Eq. (16) improves the behaviour of pressure near the wall boundaries by avoiding the troublesome dynamic pressure and avoiding to compute the normalized density gradient. However, it must be noted that the formulation of [Antuono et al., 2010] is consistent and it can be adopted for any type of flow, whereas the use of total density in the diffusive term of Eq. (16) is expected to work better than Eq. (15.2) mostly for gravity-dominated flows. In the absence of a gravity force the formulation collapses to the original formulation of [Molteni and Colagrossi, 2009].

## 3.6 Shifting algorithm
Anisotropic particle spacing is an important stability issue in SPH as, especially in
violent flows, particles cannot maintain a uniform distribution. The result is the
introduction of noise in the velocity and pressure field, as well as the creation of voids
within the water flow for certain cases.

To counter the anisotropic particle spacing, [Xu et al., 2009] proposed a particle shifting
algorithm to prevent the instabilities. The algorithm was first created for incompressible
SPH, but can be extended to the weakly compressible SPH model used in
DualSPHysics [Vacondio et al., 2013]. With the shifting algorithm, the particles are
moved (“shifted”) towards areas with fewer particles (lower particle concentration)
allowing the domain to maintain a uniform particle distribution and eliminating any
voids that may occur due to the noise.

An improvement on the initial shifting algorithm was proposed by [Lind et al., 2012]
who used Fick’s first law of diffusion to control the shifting magnitude and direction.
Fick’s first law connects the diffusion flux to the concentration gradient:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/N4Ufk40.png"/> (21)
</p>

where J is the flux, C the particle concentration, and D<sub>F</sub> the Fickian diffusion coefficient.

Assuming that the flux, i.e. the number of particles passing through a unit surface in
unit time, is proportional to the velocity of the particles, a particle shifting velocity and
subsequently a particle shifting distance can be found. Using the particle concentration,
the particle shifting distance δr<sub>s</sub> is given by:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UZtavpb.png"/> (22)
</p>

where D is a new diffusion coefficient that controls the shifting magnitude and absorbs
the constants of proportionality. The gradient of the particle concentration can be found
through an SPH gradient operator:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/c6fJZ7j.png"/> (23)
</p>

The proportionality coefficient D is computed through a form proposed by [Skillen et
al., 2013]. It is set to be large enough to provide effective particle shifting, while not
introducing significant errors or instabilities. This is achieved by performing a Von
Neumann stability analysis of the advection-diffusion equation:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6d2cuqH.png"/> (24)
</p>

where Δt<sub>max</sub> is the maximum local time step that is permitted by the CFL condition for a
given local velocity and particle spacing. The CFL condition states that:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/14FfvsR.png"/> (25)
</p>

Combining Eq. 24 and 25 we can derive an equation to find the shifting coefficient D:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H42Ukai.png"/> (26)
</p>

where A is a dimensionless constant that is independent of the problem setup and
discretization and dt is the current time step. Values in the range of [1,6] are proposed
with 2 used as default.

The shifting algorithm is heavily dependent on a full kernel support. However, particles
at and adjacent to the free surface cannot obtain the full kernel support, which will
introduce errors in the free-surface prediction, potentially causing non-physical
instabilities. Applying Fick’s law directly would result in the rapid diffusion of fluid
particles from the fluid bulk, due to the large concentration gradients at the free surface.

To counter this effect, [Lind et al., 2012] proposed a free-surface correction that limits
diffusion to the surface normal but allow shifting on the tangent to the free surface.
Therefore, this correction is only used near the free surface, identified by the value of
the particle divergence, which is computed through the following equation, first
proposed by [Lee et al., 2008]:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/x6jnVya.png"/> (27)
</p>

This idea is applied to the DualSPHysics code by multiplying the shifting distance of
Equation (22) with a free-surface correction coefficient AFSC.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/o0itVZQ.png"/> (28.1)
</p>

where AFST is the free-surface threshold and AFSM is the maximum value of the particle
divergence. The latter depends on the domain dimensions:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yz8AusQ.png"/> (28.2)
</p>

while the free surface threshold is selected for DualSPHysics as:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SE2ii1z.png"/> (28.3)
</p>

To identify the position of the particle relative to the free surface, the difference of the
particle divergence to AFST is used. Therefore, the full shifting equation (Eq. 22) with the
free surface correction is:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jRvCb13.png"/> (29)    
</p>

More information about the shifting implementation can be found in [Mokos, 2013].

## 3.7 Time stepping

In DualSPHysics two explicit time integration schemes are implemented. For brevity, the governing equations are written as 
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FgNdkyu.png"/>   
</p>

These equations are integrated in time using a computationally simple Verlet based
scheme or a more numerically stable but computationally intensive two-stage
Symplectic method.

###  3.7.1 Verlet time integration scheme
The Verlet scheme [Verlet, 1967] commonly used in molecular dynamics is a low computational cost scheme with a second order accurate space integrator that does not require multiple calculation steps within an iteration interval, the WCSPH variables are calculated according to

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NMMZ0Gk.png"/> (30)   
</p>

Due to the integration over a staggered time interval for the velocity and density, the equations are decoupled which may lead to divergence of the integrated values, therefore an intermediate step is required every Ns steps (Ns≈40 is recommended) according to

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/byqwAGl.png"/> (31) 
</p>

###  3.7.2 Position Verlet time integration scheme
The symplectic position Verlet time integrator scheme [Leimkuhler and Matthews, 2016] is second order accurate in time, ideal for Lagrangian schemes, as it is time reversible and symmetric in the absence of diffusive terms that preserves geometric futures. The position Verlet scheme in the absence of dissipation forces reads, 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F0SXWLS.png"/> (32)  
</p>  

However, in the presence of viscous forces and density evolution in DualSPHysics, the velocity is required in n+1/2 step thus, a velocity Verlet half step is used to compute the required velocity in computing the acceleration and density evolution for <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NKTN7KH.png" /> and <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rwE7RxE.png" /> respectively. The scheme implemented in DualSPHysics reads,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3iJjsDq.png"/> (33)   
</p>

where <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QtK6OgJ.png" /> is substituted to <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qmeH0rw.png" /> in Eq. 32 to eliminate dependence on <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bTA6E2W.png" />.

Finally, the density evolution follows the half time steps of the symplectic position Verlet scheme as follows [Parshikov et al, 2000], 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dRZt4Eb.png"/> (34)   
</p>

where <img src="https://i.imgur.com/M6npZCw.png" />.

### 3.7.3 Variable time step
With explicit time integration schemes the timestep is dependent on the Courant-
Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, the forcing terms and the viscous diffusion term. A
variable time step Δt is calculated according to [Monaghan et al., 1999] using

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NphKClh.png"/> (35)
</p>

where Δtf is based on the force per unit mass (|fa|), and Δtcv combines the Courant and
the viscous time step controls.

## 3.8 Boundary conditions
In DualSPHysics, the boundary is described by a set of particles that are considered as a
separate set to the fluid particles. The software currently provides functionality for solid
impermeable and periodic open boundaries. Methods to allow boundary particles to be
moved according to fixed forcing functions are also present.

### 3.8.1 Dynamic Boundary Condition

The Dynamic Boundary Condition (DBC) is the default method provided by
DualSPHysics [Crespo et al., 2007]. This method sees boundary particles that satisfy the
same equations as fluid particles, however they do not move according to the forces
exerted on them. Instead, they remain either fixed in position or move according to an
imposed/assigned motion function (i.e. moving objects such as gates, wave-makers or
floating objects).

When a fluid particle approaches a boundary and the distance between its particles and
the fluid particle becomes smaller than twice the smoothing length (h), the density of
the affected boundary particles increases, resulting in a pressure increase. In turn this
results in a repulsive force being exerted on the fluid particle due to the pressure term in
the momentum equation.

Stability of this method relies on the length of time step taken being suitably short in
order to handle the highest present velocity of any fluid particles currently interacting
with boundary particles and is therefore an important point when considering how the
variable time step is calculated.

Note that different boundary conditions have been tested in DualSPHysics in the work of [Domínguez et al., 2015]. 

### 3.8.2 Periodic open boundary condition

DualSPHysics provides support for open boundaries in the form of a periodic boundary
condition. This is achieved by allowing particles that are near an open lateral boundary
to interact with the fluid particles near the complimentary open lateral boundary on the
other side of the domain.

In effect, the compact support kernel of a particle is clipped by the nearest open
boundary and the remainder of its clipped support applied at the complimentary open
boundary [Gómez-Gesteira et al., 2012a].

### 3.8.3 Pre-imposed boundary motion

Within DualSPHysics it is possible to define a pre-imposed movement for a set of
boundary particles. Various predefined movement functions are available as well as the
ability to assign a time-dependant input file containing kinematic detail.
These boundary particles behave as a DBC described in Section 3.8.1, however rather
than being fixed, they move independently of the forces currently acting upon them.
This provides the ability to define complex simulation scenarios (i.e. a wave-making
paddle) as the boundaries influence the fluid particles appropriately as they move.

### 3.8.4 Fluid-driven objects

It is also possible to derive the movement of an object by considering its interaction
with fluid particles and using these forces to drive its motion. This can be achieved by
summing the force contributions for an entire body. By assuming that the body is rigid,
the net force on each boundary particle is computed according to the sum of the
contributions of all surrounding fluid particles according to the designated kernel
function and smoothing length. Each boundary particle k therefore experiences a force
per unit mass given by

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KwwcVCU.png"/> (36)
</p>

where fka is the force per unit mass exerted by the fluid particle a on the boundary
particle k, which is given by

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SPQDcgI.png"/> (37)
</p>

For the motion of the moving body, the basic equations of rigid body dynamics can then
be used

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CiL3M8k.png"/> (38.1)
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X8baOKr.png"/> (38.2)
</p>

where M is the mass of the object, I the moment of inertia, V the velocity, Ω the
rotational velocity and R0 the centre of mass. Equations 38.1 and 38.2 are integrated in
time in order to predict the values of V and Ω for the beginning of the next time step.
Each boundary particle within the body then has a velocity given by

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UiKDdyy.png"/> (39)
</p>

Finally, the boundary particles within the rigid body are moved by integrating Eq. 39 in time. The works of [Monaghan et al., 2003] and [Monaghan, 2005] show that this technique conserves both linear and angular momentum. [Bouscasse et al., 2013] presented successful validations of nonlinear water wave interaction with floating bodies in SPH comparing with experimental data from [Hadzić et al., 2005] that includes deformations in the free-surface due to the presence of floating boxes and the movement of those objects during the experiment (heave, surge and roll displacements). Several validations using DualSPHysics are performed in [Canelas et al., 2015] that analyse the buoyancy-driven motion with solid objects larger than the smallest flow scales and with various densities. They compared SPH numerical results with analytical solutions, with other numerical methods [Fekken, 2004] and with experimental measurements.

### 3.8.5 Modified Dynamic Boundary Condition 

The Dynamic Boundary Condition (DBC) presents some drawbacks such as: over dissipation; the evolution of density and pressure of the fixed boundary particles leading to unphysical values for those points, and unphysically large boundary layers. Another drawback of using DBC arises when considering the steady-state 2D channel flows such as Poiseuille and Couette flows, as the boundary layer is not accurately solved unless a high resolution is used. The approximation of no-slip by setting zero velocity at each of the boundary particles fails to capture the condition for low resolutions. This then leads to higher than expected velocities close to the boundary and throughout the flow. Despite all this, DBC can be successfully used for coastal engineering problems due the capability of discretizing complex 3D geometries without the need of implementing complex mirroring techniques or semi-analytical wall boundary conditions. 

We will describe here the approach presented in [English et al. 2019] that includes a modification of DBC (mDBC). Within this implementation, the boundary particles are arranged in the same way as the boundary particles in the original DBC, with the boundary interface located half a particle spacing from the inner most layer of boundary particles. For each boundary particle a ghost node is projected into the fluid across the boundary interface in a similar procedure to [Marrone et al. 2011]. For a flat surface the ghost node is mirrored across the boundary interface along the direction of the boundary normal pointing into the fluid (Figure 3-1a) and fluid properties are found at this ghost node through a corrected SPH sum over the surrounding fluid particles only (Figure 3-1b). For a boundary particle located in a corner using the boundary normal would not work due to the presence of more than one normal. However, the boundary interfaces of each solid boundary meet to form an interface corner, and the ghost node is mirrored through the point of this corner into the fluid region (Figure 3-1c). Again, fluid properties are found at the ghost node through a corrected SPH sum of the surrounding fluid (Figure 3-1d).

The boundary particles receive fluid properties using the values calculated at the ghost node and an extrapolation method similar to the one used for open boundaries in [Tafuni et al. 2018]. For the density of the boundary particle _ρ_<sub>_b_</sub> the density _ρ_<sub>_g_</sub> and its gradient [_∂_<sub>_x_</sub>_ρ_<sub>_g_</sub>;_∂_<sub>_y_</sub>_ρ_<sub>_g_</sub>;_∂_<sub>_z_</sub>_ρ_<sub>_g_</sub>] are computed at the ghost node using the first order consistent SPH interpolation proposed by [Liu and Liu, 2006], which requires solving the following linear system for each ghost node _g_: 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U0djbpZ.png"/> (40)      
</p>

where:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MoDleaJ.png"/> (41)  
</p>

where the volume _V_<sub>_j_</sub> is computed as _V_<sub>_j_</sub>=_m_<sub>_j_</sub> ⁄ _ρ_<sub>_j_</sub>.

To evaluate the matrix **A**<sub>_g_</sub> and the vector **b**<sub>_g_</sub> at each ghost node _g_, a new particle interaction loop needs to be calculated. The new interaction requires the inversion of the matrix **A**<sub>_g_</sub>; however, this requires limited additional computational efforts when compared to the original DBC formulation. Note also that the matrix **A**<sub>_g_</sub> is diagonally dominant so rarely becomes ill-conditioned, even for a very disordered particle distribution. Due to this property, the adopted formulation to compute _ρ_<sub>_g_</sub>  and [_∂_<sub>_x_</sub>_ρ_<sub>_g_</sub>;_∂_<sub>_y_</sub>_ρ_<sub>_g_</sub>;_∂_<sub>_z_</sub>_ρ_<sub>_g_</sub>] is still suitable for real engineering applications with fragmented free surfaces.
Once the density and density gradient are computed at the ghost node, then the density of the boundary particle _ρ_<sub>_g_</sub> is obtained by means of a Taylor series expansion with the values found using the above relations through:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4PfXF8a.png"/> (42)   
</p>

where **r**<sub>_g_</sub> and **r**<sub>_g_</sub> are the position of the boundary particle and associated ghost node respectively. Using this method to find the density of the boundary particle, creates smoother and more physical pressure and density fields in the boundary, and reduces the gap between the boundary and the fluid observed when using only DBC. The velocity at the ghost node is found using a Shepard filter sum 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rmuXT0p.png"/> (43)   
</p>

The boundary particle then receives this velocity with the direction reversed to create a no-slip condition at the boundary interface. The no-slip condition created using this method is more accurate than using the zero-velocity approach of the original DBC as the negative velocity is more effective at reducing the velocity of the fluid. With this method it is also possible to create a free slip boundary by giving the boundary particles the exact tangential velocity found at the ghost node.


## 3.9 Wave generation

Wave generation is included in this version of DualSPHysics, which includes piston- and flap-type long-crested wave generation. In this way, the numerical model can be used to simulate a physical wave flume. Both monochromatic (regular) and random waves can be generated. Second-order correction for bound long waves (sub-harmonics) is implemented for random waves with piston-type wave maker only. For regular waves, second-order correction (super-harmonics) is implemented for both piston- and flap-type wavemaker. The following sections refer only to the piston-type wavemaker. 

### 3.9.1 First order wave generation

The Biesel transfer functions express the relation between wave amplitude and
wavemaker displacement [Biesel and Suquet, 1951], under the assumption of
irrotational and incompressible fluid and constant pressure at the free surface. The
transfer function links the displacement of the piston-type wavemaker to the water
surface elevation, under the hypothesis of monochromatic sinusoidal waves in one
dimension in the x-direction:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/09DGr2k.png"/> (44)
</p>

where H is the wave height, d the water depth, x is distance and δ is the initial phase.
The quantity ω=2π/T is the angular frequency and k=2π/L is the wave number with T
equal to the wave period and L the wave length. The initial phase δ is given by a random
number between 0 and 2π.

Eq. 44 expresses the surface elevation at infinity that Biesel defined as the far-field
solution. The Biesel function can be derived for the far-field solution and for a pistontype
wavemaker as:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SvRgilX.png"/> (45)
</p>

where _S_<sub>_0_</sub> is the piston stroke. Once the piston stroke is defined, the time series of the
piston movement is given by:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IrxhSZv.png"/> (46)
</p>

### 3.9.2 Second-order wave generation of regular waves

The implementation of a second order wavemaker theory will prevent the generation of
spurious secondary waves. The second order wave generation theory implemented in
DualSPHysics is based on [Madsen, 1971] who developed a simple second-order
wavemaker theory to generate long second order Stokes waves that would not change
shape as they propagated. The theory proposed by [Madsen, 1971] is straightforward,
controllable, computationally inexpensive with efficient results, and is accurate for
waves of first and second order.

The piston stroke _S_<sub>_0_</sub> can be redefined from Eq. 45 as _S_<sub>_0_</sub>=_H_/_m_<sub>_1_</sub> where:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pMrwuHN.png"/> (47)
</p>

Following [Madsen, 1971], to generate a wave of second order, an extra term must be
added to Eq. 46. This term, for piston-type wavemaker, is equal to:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/mSOthJB.png"/> (48)
</p>

Therefore, the piston displacement, for regular waves, is the summation of Eq. 46 and
Eq. 48:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/drslhT6.png"/> (49)
</p>

Madsen limited the application of this approximate second order wavemaker theory to
waves that complied with the condition given by HL^2/d^3 < (8π^2)/3. A specific warning is
implemented in DualSPHysics to inform the user whether or not this condition is
fulfilled.

### 3.9.3 First order wave generation of irregular waves

Monochromatic waves are not representative of sea states that characterise real wave
storm conditions. Sea waves are mostly random or irregular in nature. Irregular wave
generation is performed in DualSPHysics based on [Liu and Frigaard, 2001]. Starting from an assigned wave spectra, the Biesel transfer function (Eq. 45) is applied to each
component in which the spectrum is discretised. The procedure for the generation of
irregular waves is summarised as follows:

1. Defining the wave spectrum through its characteristic parameters (peak frequency,
spectrum shape, etc.).
2. Dividing the spectrum into N parts (N>50) in the interval (fstart, fstop), where generally
the values assumed by the spectrum (Sη) at the extremes of this interval are smaller
than the value assumed for the peak frequency, fp: Sη(fstart)≤0.01·Sη(fp) and
Sη(fstop) ≤ 0.01 · Sη(fp).
3. The frequency band width is so-defined as Δf=(fstop-fstart)/N. The irregular wave is
decomposed into N linear waves.
4. Determining the angular frequency ωi, amplitude ai and initial phase δi (random
number between 0 and 2π) of each i-th linear wave. The angular frequency ωi and
amplitude ai can therefore be expressed as follows:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BX5XM7z.png"/> (50)
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RlBhsSH.png"/> (51)
</p>

5. Converting the time series of surface elevation into the time series of piston
movement with the help of Biesel transfer function:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pE2Y1vl.png"/> (52)
</p>

6. Composing all the i-th components derived from the previous equation into the time
series of the piston displacement as:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5XfBBNK.png"/> (53)
</p>

In DualSPHysics two standard wave spectra have been implemented and used to
generate irregular waves: JONSWAP and Pierson-Moskowitz spectra. The
characteristic parameters of each spectrum can be assigned by the user together with the
value of N (number of parts in which the spectrum is divided).

The user can choose among four different ways to define the angular frequency. It can
be determined assuming an equidistant discretization of the wave spectrum
(fi=fstart+iΔf-Δf/2), or chosen as unevenly distributed between (i-0.5)Δf and (i+0.5)Δf.
An unevenly distributed band width should be preferred: in fact, depending on N, an
equidistant splitting can lead to the repetition of the same wave group in the time series
that can be easily avoided using an unevenly distributed band width. The last two ways
to determine the angular frequency of each component and its band width consist of the
application of a stretched or cosine stretched function. The use of a stretched or cosine
stretched function has been proven to lead the most accurate results in terms of wave
height distribution and groupiness, even when the number of spectrum components N, is
relatively low. If there is a certain wave group that is repeating, finally the full range of
wave heights and wave periods is not reproduced and statistically the wave train is not
representing a real sea state of random waves.

A phase seed is also used and can be changed in DualSPHysics to obtain different
random series of δi. Changing the phase seed allows generating different irregular wave
time series both with the same significant wave height (_H_<sub>_m0_</sub>) and peak period (_T_<sub>_p_</sub>).

### 3.9.4 Second-order bound long waves

When natural waves are reproduced in a laboratory or in a numerical model the wave generator is normally controlled by a first-order signal. The wave set-down (bound long waves) generates drift velocities directed landwards under the crests and seawards under the troughs [Ottesen-Hansen et al., 1980]. However, at the wavemaker, there is no flow through the paddle, therefore the natural drift velocities are compensated by identical ones with opposite signs. The latter velocities create a progressive long wave that is not bound anymore but free. This phenomenon is called parasitic long waves and it results in an exaggeration of the long wave effects. Second-order wave generation is required in order to cancel out this parasitic long wave to achieve the drift velocities that characterise the set-down. Another long wave, called displacement long wave, is caused by finite wavemaker displacements away from the mean position. 

The correction of the first-order wave generation at the wavemaker must be capable of compensating both parasitic long waves and displacement long waves. The method implemented in DualSPHysics is based on the solution for the control signal of the wavemaker that is described in [Barthel et al., 1993].

### 3.9.5 Solitary waves

Generation of solitary waves in DualSPHysics is achieved by means moving boundaries. In particular, a piston-type wavemaker is employed to generate single and multiple solitary waves [Dominguez et al., 2019].

3.9.5.1. Single solitary wave

Goring [1978] laid the groundwork for the generation of solitary waves by means of a piston-type wavemaker.His method was based on one fundamental hypothesis: the horizontal velocity of the water particles under the wave crest, u (depth-integrated velocity), is equal to the velocity of the wavemaker.

Equation (54) defines the aforementioned assumption, where xs refers to the piston displacement.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ojjbi9S.png"/> (54)
</p>
The depth-average velocity can be expressed by equation (55), where c is the wave celerity, h is the still water depth and η is the free surface elevation.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nA3qufe.png"/> (55)
</p>
Combining and integrating equations (54) and (55), the piston displacement in time can be expressed as:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HbKY0wt.png"/> (56)
</p>
in which the parameter k is the outskirt coefficient, which describes the way the free surface elevation tends towards the mean level at infinity. The solitary wave profile is given by:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oEiyqrZ.png"/> (57)
</p>
Equation (57) is an implicit equation that needs to be solved by numerical methods.

In order to give the possibility to the user to generate the solitary wave profile that would be the most appropriate for his problem and the closest the the real studied phenomenon (e.g. tsunami wave), three different theories for solitary wave generation have been implemented in DualSPHysics. For all cases, a piston-type wavemaker is employed. The three different approaches result in different wave propagation properties (i.e. different loss of amplitude and differences in generated trailing waves) [Dominguez et al., 2019].
One solution is derived from the Rayleigh solitary wave solution; the second one uses a wavemaker law-of-motion derived from the KdV solution; the third one consists of solving equation (57) iteratively using the Newton-Raphson method. The following subsections described the three different theories.

a) Rayleigh approximation to a solitary wave
Following Serre (1953), the theoretical free-surface elevation expressed by equation (57) can be re-written as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MB4l5QB.png"/> (58)
</p>
The quantity 2*sqrt(H(H+h)/3) corresponds to half wavemaker stroke (SR) and takes into account that in DualSPHysics the origin of the wavemaker movement is set as x=0. The quantity defined as c is the wave celerity; Tf is the generation time used to form the solitary wave, xs is the wavemaker displacement and k is the outskirt coefficient. All these parameters are defined as follows (H and h refer to the wave height and to the water depth, respectively):
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VgSU24A.png"/> (59)
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xdyn57T.png"/> (60)
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AMFQIpn.png"/> (61)
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jfSPs4S.png"/> (62)
</p>

b) First-order shallow water model (KdV)
Clamond and Germain (1999) used a paddle law of motion derived from the KdV (first-order shallow water) solution. The piston displacement can be expressed as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gnQJKLz.png"/> (63)
</p>
where the outskirt coefficient is now expressed as:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gcohldt.png"/> (64)
</p>
and cKdV can be expressed as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e55poUn.png"/> (65)
</p>

c) Goring solution (Boussinesq)
Equations (56) and (57) correspond, respectively, to the equation of the piston displacement and the theoretical water elevation using the solution proposed by Goring which requires an iterative procedure to solve Equation (56).

3.9.5.2. Multiple solitary waves

To generate a series of multiple solitary waves, the law of motion of the wavemaker is calculated for each i-th solitary wave. Any of the three theories indicated in the previous sections can be used. Then, the time lag between the i+1-th and the i-th solitary wave has to be specified as a fraction or multiple of the generation time used for the i-th solitary wave. The time lag-between the generation of the two solitary waves will be expressed by λTf, being Tf the generation time used to generated the first solitary wave. The coefficient λ is a positive real number that multiplies Tf. If λ<1, the generation of the second solitary wave starts when the displacement of the piston has not reached yet the maximum stroke that is needed to generate the first solitary wave.

The generation of multiple solitary waves is a simple but efficient way to model a wave train of several tsunamis which might have been triggered by the same tectonic event.


## 3.10 Passive and active wave absorption 

The use of wave absorption allows generating long time series of sea waves in relatively short domains with negligible wave reflection. Wave absorption techniques can be categorized as passive and active, respectively. Passive wave absorbers are usually required to damp the wave energy and to reduce reflection exerted by the boundary of the model domain. In active absorption systems, the wavemaker real-time displacement is corrected to cancel out the reflected waves and to damp the re-reflection phenomenon. Active wave absorption is implemented in DualSPHysics for a piston-type wavemaker only.

### 3.10.1 Passive wave absorption 

A damping zone is implemented in DualSPHysics as passive absorption system. The implemented damping system consists in gradually reducing the velocity of the particles at each time step according to their location, but using quadratic decay rather than exponential. In this way, the velocity is modified following

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nP4ErE9.png"/> (66)
</p>

where v0 is the initial velocity of the particle i, v is the final velocity and f(x,Δt) is the reduction function defined as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B1omhTk.png"/> (67)
</p>

where Δt is the duration of the last time step, x is position of the particles, x0 and x1 are the initial and final position of the damping zone, respectively. It is recommended to use one wavelength, L, as the length of the damping zone. The coefficient β modifies the reduction function that is applied to the velocity.

### 3.10.2 Active wave absorption 

The active wave absorption system implemented in DualSPHysics is based on the time-domain filtering technique that uses the free-surface elevation at the wavemaker position as feedback for the control of the wavemaker displacement. The target wavemaker position e(t) is corrected in real time in order to avoid reflection at the wavemaker. It is necessary to estimate the free-surface elevation of the reflected waves, ηR, to be absorbed, by comparing the target incident free-surface elevation, ηI, with the measured one in front of the wavemaker, ηSPH. This is measured at 4-10·hSPH from the wavemaker. The reflected free-surface elevation can be expressed as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xZHfwS1.png"/> (68)
</p>

The wavemaker velocity is then modified to match the velocity induced by the wave that will be absorbed. For a piston-type wavemaker the wave absorption is performed using linear long wave theory [Schaffer and Klopman, 2000; Dean and Dalrymple, 1991]. The velocity correction to absorb the reflected waves, UR, is expressed as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rbQWWOO.png"/> (69)
</p>

where ηR is the free-surface elevation of the reflected waves and g is the gravitational acceleration. The corrected wavemaker velocity UC is the subtraction of UR from the theoretical wave maker velocity UI. This UI is the derivative in time of the wavemaker displacement e(t). Here the implementation details are expressed for the regular wave case. The theoretical velocity at time t, UI(t), can be computed as: 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BOHNsjX.png"/> (70)
</p>

The free-surface elevation in front of the wavemaker is measured, the target incident free-surface elevation is calculated and therefore the velocity correction UR is estimated. The corrected wavemaker velocity at the instant t+dt can be expressed as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/x5BTFSp.png"/> (71)
</p>

The wavemaker position at t+dt is then corrected using the following expression

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WMWWQ8E.png"/> (72)
</p>

Small deviations of the mean water level from the zero can imply accumulations in time leading to a drift of the wavemaker from its initial position that will grow indefinitely. In order to prevent this drift, the wavemaker should be forced back to its zero position. Hence, a drift correction algorithm is implemented in the code. The algorithm checks when the 80% of the maximum forward or backward stroke is reached (80% was assumed as default value but it can be modified by the user). If this happens the wave board is pushed/pulled slowly back, while continuing to generate the target waves, in such a way that its average position will finally correspond to its initial zero-position (i.e. at the beginning of the simulation). A smoothed transition, in form of a power function, is used to prevent abrupt changes in the wavemaker displacement.

## 3.11 Coupling with Discrete Element Method (DEM)

The discrete element method (DEM) allows for the computation of rigid particle
dynamics, by considering contact laws to account for interaction forces. The coupled
numerical solution, based on SPH and DEM discretisations, resolves solid-solid and
solid-fluid interactions over a broad range of scales.

Forces arise whenever a particle of a solid object interacts with another. In the particular
case of a solid-solid collision, the contact force is decomposed into Fn and Ft, normal
and tangential components respectively. Both of these forces include viscous dissipation
effects. This is because two colliding bodies undergo a deformation which will be
somewhere between perfectly inelastic and perfectly elastic, usually quantified by the
normal restitution coefficient

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FI6n4e6.png"/> (73)
</p>

The total forces are decomposed into a repulsion force, Fr, arising from the elastic
deformation of the material, and a damping force, Fd, for the viscous dissipation of
energy during the deformation.

Figure 3-2 generally illustrates the proposed viscoelastic DEM mechanism between two
interacting particles.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cf4aUv1.png"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>Figure 3-2.</strong> Schematic interaction between particles with viscoelastic DEM mechanism.
</p>

The normal force is given by

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JSWjteL.png"/> (74)
</p>

where the stiffness is given by

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E09Sbv7.png"/> (75)
</p>

and the damping coefficient is

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3SywlkB.png"/> (76)
</p>

where <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qJFoGej.png" /> is the unit vector between the centers of particles i and j.

The restitution coefficient ij e is taken as the average of the two materials coefficients, in
what is the only calibration parameter of the model. It is not a physical parameter, but
since the current method does not account for internal deformations and other energy
losses during contact, the user is given a choice to change this parameter freely in order
to control the dissipation of each contact. The reduced radius and reduced elasticity are
given by

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NFNi4cg.png"/> (77)
</p>

where Ri is simply the particle radius, Ei is the Young modulus and νp is the Poisson
coefficient of material i, as specified in the Floating_Materials.xml.

This results in another restriction to the time-step, adding

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CBkNVwo.png"/> (78)
</p>

to the existing CFL restrictions (Eq. 35), where vn is the normal relative velocity and M*
is the reduced mass of the system where there is a contact.

Regarding tangential contacts, friction is modelled using the same model:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TEWT5wl.png"/> (79)
</p>

where the stiffness and damping constants are derived to be

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/I0k85MJ.png"/> (80)
</p>

as to insure internal consistency of the time scales between normal and tangential
components. This mechanism models the static and dynamic friction mechanisms by a
penalty method. The body does not statically stick at the point of contact, but is
constrained by the spring-damper system. This force must be bounded above by the
Coulomb friction law, modified with a sigmoidal function in order to make it
continuous around the origin regarding the tangential velocity:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KeEhBWb.png"/> (81)
</p>

where μIJ is the friction coefficient at the contact of object I and object J and is simply
taken as the average of the two friction coefficients of the distinct materials, indicated in
the Floating_Materials.xml.

More information about DEM implementation can be found in [Canelas, 2015; Canelas
et al., 2016].

## 3.12 Coupling DualSPHysics with Project Chrono

### 3.12.1 General implementation and capabilities

Devices composed of rigid bodies interacting through frictional contacts and several nonlinear constraints are extensively used in many engineering fields, either featuring a small number of unilateral contacts or including thousands of contacts between a large number of parts. Mechanisms involving contacts and impacts between parts can be modeled in terms of multi-body systems with unilateral constraints. The simulation of rigid contacts entails the solution of non-smooth equations of motion: the dynamics are non-smooth since the non-interpenetration, collision, and adhesion constraints are discontinuous. Considering the success of SPH for fluid descriptions and non-smooth multibody solvers for mechanical systems, attempting to couple both under a
generalized framework should provide new simulation possibilities, by leveraging the strengths in both methods.

The multi-body solver used is [Project Chrono](http://projectchrono.org/), an open-source high-performance library and set of applications enabling many applications such as wheeled and tracked vehicles operating on deformable terrains, robots, mechatronic systems, compliant mechanisms, and fluid solid interaction phenomena. Systems can be made of rigid and flexible/compliant parts with constraints, motors and contacts; parts can have three-dimensional shapes for collision detection. 

DualSPHysics at the moment uses the rigid body, constraints and collision detection parts of the library. This allows a user to use a set of bodies described in meshes, specify restrictions applied to the bodies (from the implemented list of joints, hinges and springs) and compute interactions between bodies, in a similar fashion to the DEM implementation, but in a more stable manner. Realistic frictional behavior is also now possible, since a full Coulomb sliding/sticking/rolling model is used.

The implementation strategy is to couple both models with a message passing interface. Once quantities from the rigid bodies are computed by DualSPHysics, the time step, along with the linear and angular accelerations from each body, computed solely from fluid- body interaction, are sent to our Project Chrono module. For that time step, Chrono returns the linear and angular velocities, as well as CC position, computed by integrating the fluid contributions with the dynamic or kinematic restrictions of the system, including collisions.

### 3.12.2 Multibody representation for rigid bodies - System representation

Section 3.8 lays the fundamental ideas behind the modelling of the fluid phase and the modelling of otherwise unconstrained floating rigid bodies. Mechanisms to cope with interactions between rigid bodies and other constraints need to be explored. The ideas laid by [Potapov-2001](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~campbell/LiquidSolidSPH.pdf) and later adapted by [Canelas-al-2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465516000254) represent traditional regularization strategies, which model contacts and other restrictions by means of spring-dashpot systems (DEM class methods). From a SPH implementation perspective, this approach requires small code adaptations and allows the adoption of already used integrators. The high stiffness affecting the explicit integration, however, typically imposes prohibitively small time steps to ensure stability and guarantees the need to tune parameters [Kruggel-Emden-2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314154405_A_strategy_to_determine_DEM_parameters_for_spherical_and_non-spherical_particles). These issues motivate the search for methods that can deal with multiple frictional restrictions, even in cases with thousands or millions of moving bodies. To that end, much attention was drawn by time-stepping approaches that produce weak solutions of the DVI that describes the continuous time motion of rigid bodies with collision, contact, and friction, as those applied in Project Chrono. The DVI as a problem formulation was recently introduced in full generality and classified by differential index [Pang-2008](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234647755_Differential_variational_inequalities), though earlier numerical approaches based on DVI formulations do exist. On the following subsections, a DVI description is built by defining the notation space, writing constraints that represent physical characteristics of the system and finally writing the full equation system.

At a time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$t$" title="$t$" />, the position of the system is described by generalized coordinates <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbf{q}(t)&space;\in&space;\mathbb{R}^m$" title="$\mathbf{q}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$" /> (which may include rotational coordinates that cannot be defined over a subspace homeomorphic to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbb{R}^n$" title="$\mathbb{R}^n$" />, for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$n$" title="$n$" />), and generalized velocities <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbf{v}(t)&space;\in&space;\mathbb{R}^m$" title="$\mathbf{v}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$" />. In classical mechanics, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbf{v}(t)&space;\in&space;\mathbb{R}^m$" title="$\mathbf{v}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$" /> is continuous, and we can write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$d\mathbf{q}/dt&space;=&space;\mathbf{\Gamma}(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{v}$" title="$d\mathbf{q}/dt = \mathbf{\Gamma}(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{v}$" />, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbf{\Gamma}(\mathbf{q})$" title="$\mathbf{\Gamma}(\mathbf{q})$" /> is used to transform the generalized velocities into derivatives of the generalized positions. For instance, when dealing with rotations, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{\Gamma}(\ve{q})$" title="$\ve{\Gamma}(\ve{q})$" /> can be a linear mapping from three dimensional angular speeds into four dimensional time derivatives of unit quaternions. Four-dimensional unitary quaternions are adopted, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbf{\eta}(t)&space;\in&space;S^3&space;\subset&space;\mathbb{H}$" title="$\mathbf{\eta}(t) \in S^3 \subset \mathbb{H}$" />, though their space is not homeomorphic to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbb{R}^3$" title="$\mathbb{R}^3$" />. This allows the position vector as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbf{q}=\{&space;\mathbf{x}_1^T,&space;\mathbf{\eta}_1^T,\mathbf{x}_2^T,&space;\mathbf{\eta}_2^T,...\}$" title="$\mathbf{q}=\{ \mathbf{x}_1^T, \mathbf{\eta}_1^T,\mathbf{x}_2^T, \mathbf{\eta}_2^T,...\}$" /> and the velocity vector as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbf{v}=\{\mathbf{\dot{x}}_1^T,&space;\mathbf{w}_1^T,\mathbf{\dot{x}}_2^T,&space;\mathbf{w}_2^T,...\}$" title="$\mathbf{v}=\{\mathbf{\dot{x}}_1^T, \mathbf{w}_1^T,\mathbf{\dot{x}}_2^T, \mathbf{w}_2^T,...\}$" />. Therefore a system with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$n$" title="$n$" /> bodies in three dimensions is represented by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$m_p=8n$" title="$m_p=8n$" /> position and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$m_s=6n$" title="$m_s=6n$" /> speed coordinates.

### 3.12.3 Non-penetration constraints

Two rigid bodies should not penetrate, and, if they are in contact, there should be friction acting at the interface. To enforce the non-penetration constraint, we assume that there exists a function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\Phi(\mathbf{q})$" title="$\Phi(\mathbf{q})$" /> which we call the gap function, that satisfies

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Phi(q)=&space;\begin{cases}&space;>&space;0&space;&&space;\text{If&space;the&space;bodies&space;have&space;no&space;intersection}&space;\\&space;=&space;0&space;&&space;\text{If&space;the&space;bodies&space;are&space;in&space;contact}&space;\\&space;<&space;0&space;&&space;\text{If&space;the&space;bodies&space;intersect}&space;\end{cases}" title="\Phi(q)= \begin{cases} > 0 & \text{If the bodies have no intersection} \\ = 0 & \text{If the bodies are in contact} \\ < 0 & \text{If the bodies intersect} \end{cases}"/> (82)
</p>

For such a function, the non-penetration constraint becomes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\Phi(\mathbf{q})&space;\ge&space;0$" title="$\Phi(\mathbf{q}) \ge 0$" />. An example of such a mapping is the signed distance function, which is differentiable when the bodies are smooth and convex, at least up to some value of the interpenetration. For most cases, even simple ones involving the relative position of two spheres, a differentiable signed distance function cannot be defined for all values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbf{q}$" title="$\mathbf{q}$" />. The fact that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\Phi(\mathbf{q})$" title="$\Phi(\mathbf{q})$" /> can be differentially defined only on a neighborhood of the set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\Phi(\mathbf{q})&space;\ge&space;0$" title="$\Phi(\mathbf{q}) \ge 0$" /> can be accommodated at the cost of making the analysis substantially more involved, prompting the following assumption: any contact is described by a gap function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\Phi(\mathbf{q})$" title="$\Phi(\mathbf{q})$" /> that is everywhere twice continuously differentiable.

### 3.12.4 Frictional constraints - The Coulomb friction model

The model we represent and approximate is the Coulomb friction model. If a position <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\math{q}$" title="$\math{q}$" /> is feasible and the contact is active, that is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\Phi(\mathbf{q})&space;\ge&space;0$" title="$\Phi(\mathbf{q}) \ge 0$" />, then at the contact we have a normal force and a tangential force. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{n}$" title="$\ve{n}$" /> be the normal at the contact, pointing toward the exterior of the body, and let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{t}_1$" title="$\ve{t}_1$" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{t}_2$" title="$\ve{t}_2$" /> be the tangents at the contact such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{n}$" title="$\ve{n}$" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{t}_1$" title="$\ve{t}_1$" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{t}_2$" title="$\ve{t}_2$" /> are mutually orthogonal vectors of unitary length and a function of the position <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\math{q}$" title="$\math{q}$" />. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{v}$" title="$\ve{v}$" /> to refer to velocities, and the subscripts 1 and 2 to refer to quantities related to the two linearly independent tangential directions at a given contact. The reaction force is impressed on the system by means of multipliers <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\gamma_n$" title="$\gamma_n$" />, $\gamma_{v_1}$ and $\gamma_{v_2}$. The normal component of the force is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{F}_n&space;=&space;\gamma_n&space;\ve{n}$" title="$\ve{F}_n = \gamma_n \ve{n}$" /> and the tangential component of the force is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{F}_t&space;=&space;\gamma_{v_1}&space;\ve{t}_1&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_2}&space;\ve{t}_2$" title="$\ve{F}_t = \gamma_{v_1} \ve{t}_1 + \gamma_{v_2} \ve{t}_2$" />. The Coulomb model consists of the following constraints:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\gamma_n&space;&\ge&space;0&space;\\&space;\Phi(\ve{q})&space;&\ge&space;0&space;\\&space;\Phi(\ve{q})\gamma_n&space;&=&space;0&space;\\&space;\mu\gamma_n&space;&\ge&space;\sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2&plus;\gamma_{v_2}^2}&space;\\&space;||\ve{V}_t||(\mu\gamma_n&space;-&space;\sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2&plus;\gamma_{v_2}^2})&space;&=&space;0\\&space;\langle&space;\ve{F}_t,&space;\ve{V}_t&space;\rangle&space;&=&space;-||\ve{F}_t||&space;\;&space;||\ve{V}_t||" title="\gamma_n &\ge 0 \\ \Phi(\ve{q}) &\ge 0 \\ \Phi(\ve{q})\gamma_n &= 0 \\ \mu\gamma_n &\ge \sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2+\gamma_{v_2}^2} \\ ||\ve{V}_t||(\mu\gamma_n - \sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2+\gamma_{v_2}^2}) &= 0\\ \langle \ve{F}_t, \ve{V}_t \rangle &= -||\ve{F}_t|| \; ||\ve{V}_t||"/> (83)
</p>

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{V}_t$" title="$\ve{V}_t$" /> is the relative tangential velocity at contact. The first part of the constraint can be restated as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\ve{F}=\ve{F}_n&space;&plus;&space;\ve{F}_t&space;=&space;\gamma_n&space;\ve{n}&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_1}&space;\ve{t}_1&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_2}&space;\ve{t}_2&space;\in&space;\mathbb{K}" title="\ve{F}=\ve{F}_n + \ve{F}_t = \gamma_n \ve{n} + \gamma_{v_1} \ve{t}_1 + \gamma_{v_2} \ve{t}_2 \in \mathbb{K}"/> (84)
</p>

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mathbb{K}$" title="$\mathbb{K}$" /> is a cone in three dimensions, whose slope is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\arctan(\mu)$" title="$\arctan(\mu)$" />. The constraint <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\langle&space;\ve{F}_t,&space;\ve{V}_t&space;\rangle&space;=&space;-||\ve{F}_t||&space;\;&space;||\ve{V}_t||$" title="$\langle \ve{F}_t, \ve{V}_t \rangle = -||\ve{F}_t|| \; ||\ve{V}_t||$" /> requires that the tangential force be opposite to the tangential velocity. This results in the reaction force being dissipative. In fact, an equivalent convenient way of expressing this constraint is by using the maximum dissipation principle

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\gamma_{v_1},\gamma_{v_2})=\text{argmin}_{\sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2&plus;\gamma_{v_2}^2}&space;\le&space;\mu\gamma_n}(\gamma_{v_1}&space;\ve{t}_1&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_2}&space;\ve{t}_2)^T&space;\ve{V}_t" title="(\gamma_{v_1},\gamma_{v_2})=\text{argmin}_{\sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2+\gamma_{v_2}^2} \le \mu\gamma_n}(\gamma_{v_1} \ve{t}_1 + \gamma_{v_2} \ve{t}_2)^T \ve{V}_t"/> (85)
</p>

These constraints are represented by mapping vectors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{n}$" title="$\ve{n}$" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{t}_1$" title="$\ve{t}_1$" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{t}_2$" title="$\ve{t}_2$" /> from contact coordinates to generalized coordinates. For example, if we have a two-body system, then the generalized coordinates in the three-dimensional space are embedded in a twelve-dimensional space by using the coordinates <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$x_1$,&space;$y_1$,&space;$z_1$,&space;$\phi_1$,&space;$\Theta_1$,&space;$\zeta_1$,&space;$x_2$,&space;$y_2$,&space;$z_2$,&space;$\phi_2$,&space;$\Theta_2$,&space;$\zeta_2$" title="$x_1$, $y_1$, $z_1$, $\phi_1$, $\Theta_1$, $\zeta_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, $z_2$, $\phi_2$, $\Theta_2$, $\zeta_2$" />. For a three-dimensional vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{v}$" title="$\ve{v}$" />, the mapping to generalized coordinates is given by

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\ve{v}&space;\to&space;\left(&space;\begin{matrix}&space;\ve{v}\\&space;r_1&space;\times&space;\ve{v}\\&space;-\ve{v}\\&space;-r_2&space;\times&space;\ve{v}&space;\end{matrix}&space;\right)," title="\ve{v} \to \left( \begin{matrix} \ve{v}\\ r_1 \times \ve{v}\\ -\ve{v}\\ -r_2 \times \ve{v} \end{matrix} \right),"/> (86)
</p>

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$r_1$" title="$r_1$" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$r_2$" title="$r_2$" /> are the relative positions of the contact point with respect to the centers of mass of the two bodies. Using this mapping, we denote the generalized vector version of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{n}$" title="$\ve{n}$" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{t}_1$" title="$\ve{t}_1$" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{t}_2$" title="$\ve{t}_2$" /> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$D_n$,&space;$D_1$,&space;$D_2$" title="$D_n$, $D_1$, $D_2$" />. One unfortunate side effect of generalized coordinates mapping is that, in the new coordinates, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$D_n$,&space;$D_1$,&space;$D_2$" title="$D_n$, $D_1$, $D_2$" /> cease to be mutually orthogonal.
If u is the generalized velocity, the tangential velocity satisfies the following

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\ve{t}^T_1\ve{V}_t=&space;u^TD_1,&space;\;\;\;&space;\ve{t}^T_2\ve{V}_t=&space;u^TD_2" title="\ve{t}^T_1\ve{V}_t= u^TD_1, \;\;\; \ve{t}^T_2\ve{V}_t= u^TD_2"/> (87)
</p>
 
In generalized coordinates, the Coulomb model can now be written as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_n&=\gamma_nD_n\\&space;F_t&=\gamma_{v_1}D_1&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_2}D_2\\&space;\gamma_n&space;\ge&space;0,&space;\;\;\Phi(\ve{q})&space;&&space;\ge&space;0,&space;\;\;&space;\Phi(\ve{q})\gamma_n&space;=&space;0&space;\\&space;\mu\gamma_n&space;&\ge&space;\sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2&plus;\gamma_{v_2}^2}\\&space;(\gamma_{v_1},\gamma_{v_2})&space;=&space;\text{argmin}&_{\sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2&plus;\gamma_{v_2}^2}&space;\le&space;\mu\gamma_n}(\gamma_{v_1}&space;D_1&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_2}&space;D_2)^T&space;u" title="F_n&=\gamma_nD_n\\ F_t&=\gamma_{v_1}D_1 + \gamma_{v_2}D_2\\ \gamma_n \ge 0, \;\;\Phi(\ve{q}) & \ge 0, \;\; \Phi(\ve{q})\gamma_n = 0 \\ \mu\gamma_n &\ge \sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2+\gamma_{v_2}^2}\\ (\gamma_{v_1},\gamma_{v_2}) = \text{argmin}&_{\sqrt{\gamma_{v_1}^2+\gamma_{v_2}^2} \le \mu\gamma_n}(\gamma_{v_1} D_1 + \gamma_{v_2} D_2)^T u"/> (88)
</p>

### 3.12.5 Complete multi-body model

The other dynamical data needed for the model are the mass matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{M}(\ve{q})$" title="$\ve{M}(\ve{q})$" /> and the external force <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{f_e}(t,&space;\ve{q},&space;\ve{v})$" title="$\ve{f_e}(t, \ve{q}, \ve{v})$" />. The mass matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\ve{M}(\ve{q})&space;\in&space;\mathbb{R}^{m&space;\times&space;m}$" title="$\ve{M}(\ve{q}) \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$" /> is positive definite and constant.
Assuming now that we have _p_ potential contact constraints, which are enforced by the non-penetration constraints <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\Phi^i(\ve{q})&space;\ge&space;0,&space;i&space;=&space;1,&space;2,&space;...,&space;p$" title="$\Phi^i(\ve{q}) \ge 0, i = 1, 2, ..., p$" /> . The superscript _i_ denotes the data associated to the potential contact _i_. The continuous model is the following differential variational inequality

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{d\boldsymbol{q}}{dt}=\boldsymbol{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{q})\boldsymbol{v}\\&space;M\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}=\sum_{i=1}^p(\gamma_{n}^i&space;D_n^i&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_1}^i&space;D_1^i&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_2}^i&space;D_2^i)&space;&plus;&space;\boldsymbol{f_e}(t,&space;\boldsymbol{q},&space;\boldsymbol{v})\\&space;\gamma_{n}^i&space;\ge&space;0&space;\;\;&space;\bot&space;\Phi^i(\boldsymbol{q})&space;\ge&space;0,&space;\;\;&space;i&space;=&space;1,&space;2,&space;...,&space;p\\&space;(\gamma_{v_1}^i,\gamma_{v_2}^i)&space;=&space;\text{argmin}_{\sqrt{{\gamma_{v_1}^i}^2&plus;{\gamma_{v_2}^i}^2}&space;\le&space;\mu^i\gamma_n^i}(\gamma_{v_1}^i&space;D_1^i&space;&plus;&space;\gamma_{v_2}^i&space;D_2^i)^T&space;u,&space;\\&space;i&space;=&space;1,&space;2,&space;...,&space;p" title="\frac{d\boldsymbol{q}}{dt}=\boldsymbol{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{q})\boldsymbol{v}\\ M\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}=\sum_{i=1}^p(\gamma_{n}^i D_n^i + \gamma_{v_1}^i D_1^i + \gamma_{v_2}^i D_2^i) + \boldsymbol{f_e}(t, \boldsymbol{q}, \boldsymbol{v})\\ \gamma_{n}^i \ge 0 \;\; \bot \Phi^i(\boldsymbol{q}) \ge 0, \;\; i = 1, 2, ..., p\\ (\gamma_{v_1}^i,\gamma_{v_2}^i) = \text{argmin}_{\sqrt{{\gamma_{v_1}^i}^2+{\gamma_{v_2}^i}^2} \le \mu^i\gamma_n^i}(\gamma_{v_1}^i D_1^i + \gamma_{v_2}^i D_2^i)^T u, \\ i = 1, 2, ..., p" /> (89)
</p>

System 89 must be discretized for use in a numerical model. Casting the system in Cone Complementary Problem (CCP) form and solving it with a fixed point iterative method allows for the expected performance levels, while taking advantage of the DVI capabilities in describing generalized restrictions. The full discretization can be seen in Project Chrono's reference papers, [Anitescu (2010)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10589-008-9223-4) and [Tasora (2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782510001970).

## 3.13 Coupling with wave propagation models

Multi-scaled complex simulations, often characterised by three-dimensional domains and long duration, require huge computational resources, if only one stand-alone model is employed.  Despite the significant improvements in computational time of SPH-based solvers by using GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and multi-GPU techniques [(Domínguez et al., 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465513001057), the computational cost is still high to model realistic engineering problems. In coastal engineering, in particular, it is required modelling properly all processes from wave generation to wave-structure/beach interaction. SPH-based solvers provide a detailed modelling of local phenomena, such as interaction between sea waves and coastal defenses, e.g. [Altomare et al. (2015a)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2014.11.001) and [St-Germain et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WW.1943-5460.0000225). The mesh-free nature of SPH allows mimicking the wave generation system of experimental facilities, employing moving boundaries as piston- or flap-type wavemakers. But, using this schemes, waves need to be generated and to propagate over relative long domains in order to simulate properly wave transformation and to guarantee the correct wave sea state at the toe of the structure, similarly to what happens in physical model tests. To reduce the computational cost of such simulations, less computationally demanding wave propagation models (e.g. Boussinesq models, Non-Linear Shallow Water equation models) can be coupled with SPH-based solvers.
Here two coupling schemes between DualSPHysics model and SWASH model are briefly described (Figure 3-4): multi-layered piston wavemaker [(Altomare et al., 2015b)](https://doi.org/doi:10.1142/S0578563415500242) and relaxation zone technique [(Altomare et al., 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118718303705). Both techniques are 1-way offline coupling schemes. 
The SWASH model is an open-source non-hydrostatic wave-flow model (available at swash.sourceforge.net). A full description of the numerical model, boundary conditions and numerical scheme and applications are given in [(Zijlema et al., 2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378383911000974).
The differences are following described: 
* In [(Altomare et al., 2015b)](https://doi.org/doi:10.1142/S0578563415500242) the real time displacement of the multi-layered piston wavemaker (consisting of boundary particles) is reconstructed on the basis of the velocity time series calculated by SWASH model in a specific point of the fluid domain. There is no reflection compensation, therefore the use of this technique is recommended for low-reflective cases or  very short time series. 
* In the relaxation zone technique implemented by [(Altomare et al., 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118718303705), the coupling zone is extended from one single location to an area. The orbital velocity calculated by the wave propagation model is imposed to the fluid particles in the SPH model. The particle velocity is controlled by analytical solution with a weighting _C_ function: in this way, the reflected waves are compensated inside the relaxation zone.

### 3.13.1 Multi-layered piston wavemaker

A scheme of the multi-layered approach is depicted in Figure 3-5. For sake of simplicity, the geometry of the wave flume at [Flanders Hydraulics Research](https://www.waterbouwkundiglaboratorium.be/en/home) (Belgium) is resembled as example. The top picture represents the whole flume domain and indicates the points where the coupling is set. The middle picture represents the DualSPHysics domain and multi-layered piston wavemaker consisting of SPH boundary particles. The bottom picture is the SWASH domain: the real flume geometry is replaced after the coupling point by horizontal bottom and absorbing boundary conditions. In this way, only incident wave characteristics will be measured at the coupling location. In the small box on the left-hand side of Figure 3-5, a scheme of the multi-layered boundary is depicted: the different layers indicate the number of layers used in SWASH simulation (8 is recommended). The velocities provided by SWASH at the coupling point for each layer are then translated in the boundary particle displacement and are passed to DualSPHysics. The final displacement for each of the boundary particles in SPH is calculated based on the interpolated and velocity between neighbor layers. 
The method, validated for 2DV or quasi-3D applications, has been implemented to work fully in 3D, by reading the velocity in x- and y- directions and integrated them over time to obtain the three-dimensional displacement of the moving boundaries.

### 3.13.2 Relaxation Zone (RZ) 

Relaxation zone technique is a general framework to generate waves and currents in DualSPHysics, which can be employed as stand-alone wave generation and wave absorption method, as alternative moving boundaries, or as a proper coupling scheme between DualSPHysics and a wave propagation model. The basics of the method remain the same in both cases. We refer here to implementation in 2DV or quasi-3D. Horizontal and, if necessary, vertical velocities are imposed to SPH fluid particles within a specific generation. The particle velocity distribution between the center of the relaxation zone and its extremes is controlled by with a weighting _C_ function, the use of which prevents potential particle disorder due to the discontinuity of particle velocities at the interface between the RZ and main computational region. The velocities in the RZ can be expressed as follows:

where <img src="https://imgur.com/HTSYtq1.png"/> and <img src="https://imgur.com/unrQEFM.png"/>  are the controlled horizontal and vertical velocities, <img src="https://imgur.com/yaLTzIp.png"/> and <img src="https://imgur.com/o0M0zBu.png"/> are the imposed horizontal and vertical velocities, <img src="https://imgur.com/lB54yhv.png"/> and <img src="https://imgur.com/bobJLVe.png"/> are the actual horizontal and vertical velocities measured in the numerical model. DualSPHysics gives the option to the user to use either the horizontal velocity only or both horizontal and vertical velocities to correct the particle kinematics. 
In DualSPHysics as stand-alone model, the imposed velocity consists of the analytical orbital velocities of target waves or uniform horizontal velocity profiles (for current generation). For the coupling, the time series of the velocity per layer as calculated by SWASH is used. To reconstruct the velocity profile in the RZ, several measurements along the direction of wave propagation are needed in SWASH to cover the whole generation area. Spatial interpolation and interpolation in time (time step in DualSPHysics is smaller than in SWASH) are performed before imposing the velocities to the SPH fluid particles. 
The weighting function is implemented in the form of a hyperbolic function (Figure 3-6). For a specific width of the relaxation zone, <img src="https://i.imgur.com/psjjDN6.png"/>, the _C_ function can be expressed as follows:

<p align="right">

</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>Figure 3-6.</strong> Shape of the weighting function C for different values of ψ and β.
</p>

The value assumed by the function depends on the set of values chosen for the 𝜓 and β parameters and on the distance from the center of the RZ, being zero at both extremes. The variation of the two parameters allows exploring the performance of the RZ depending on the shape of _C_.
The basic scheme of RZ is depicted in Figure 3-7, where the RZ is defined by the area bounded by the red dotted line. At the right side of the RZ it is located the main fluid domain. Since the generated waves will freely propagate in both directions along the x-axis, a damping area is placed at the left side of the RZ (bounded by a blue dotted line). It has been verified that a damping area 0.25 times the characteristic wavelength is already quite effective.

<strong>Figure 3-7.</strong> Generic scheme of relaxation zone in DualSPHysics model.

For wave generation, non-linear effects might induce a drift in the particle displacement that can be identified actually by the mass transport predicted by Stokes at second-order solution for monochromatic waves. The drift velocity can be expressed by the following equation:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/tjpMznC.png"/> (92)
</p>

This mass transport leads to water level increase in the main fluid domain and consequent water level drop in the RZ. In order to avoid unrealistic increase of water level outside the generation zone, a correction to prevent this drift has been implemented. This correction is proportional to the velocity as predicted by Stokes. 
The performance of the relaxation zone technique to generate waves and to compensate wave reflection is is described in detailed in [Altomare et al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118718303705), where a step-by-step procedure to design properly the RZ is detailed.

## 3.14 Coupling with MoorDyn

### 3.14.1 MoorDyn library

MoorDyn is an open-source dynamic mooring line model that has been designed for coupling with other numerical models ([http://www.matt-hall.ca/moordyn.html](http://www.matt-hall.ca/moordyn.html)). 

MoorDyn discretizes mooring lines as point masses (nodes _i_) connected by linear spring-damper segments to provide elasticity in the axial direction. If **r**<sub>_i_</sub> and **r**<sub>_i+1_</sub> represent the absolute position vectors of two adjacent nodes, the strain in the segment connecting them (_i_+1/2) is calculated as:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/lx4WvFZ.png"/> (93)
</p>

where _l_ is the segment unstretched length. 

The tension forces acting within each segment due to material stiffness and internal damping are then calculated, respectively, as: 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/HDOvpUr.png"/> (94)
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/XdMmI3h.png"/> (95)
</p>

where _diam_ is line diameter, _E_ is elasticity modulus and _C_<sub>_int_</sub> is the internal damping coefficient. For chains, which have very small internal structural damping, a small amount of structural damping is still included in the model to critically damp non-physical resonances that can occur at the individual segment natural frequencies due to the model discretization. Bending and torsional stiffnesses are neglected. Hydrodynamic damping and added mass are represented using the Morison equation applied to each node. The tangent direction at a node _i_ is approximated as a unit vector aligned between the nodes on either side:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/1LX88vQ.png"/> (96)
</p>

From the Morison equation, the drag force in the transverse (**D**<sub>_n_</sub>) and tangential (**D**<sub>_t_</sub>) directions applied to node _i_ are:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/B1m6f4P.png"/> (97.1)
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/HhhEqNC.png"/> (97.2)
</p>

where _C_<sub>_dn_</sub> and _C_<sub>_dt_</sub> are transverse and tangential drag coefficients, respectively. These forces are calculated assuming quiescent water; wave kinematics are neglected in MoorDyn’s calculation of hydrodynamic loads.

Added mass on each node (**a**<sub>_i_</sub>) is calculated as a matrix

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/GvTyoue.png"/> (98)
</p>

where _C_<sub>_an_</sub> and _C_<sub>_at_</sub> are transverse and tangential added mass coefficients, respectively, and **I**<sub>m</sub> is the identity matrix.

Vertical seabed contact forces (**B**<sub>_i_</sub>) are modelled by a spring-damper approach using a stiffness coefficient kb and damping coefficient _c_<sub>_b_</sub> with magnitude (Hall, 2017): 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/Ov69Hns.png"/> (99)
</p>

that is activated whenever the elevation of a node, _z_<sub>_i_</sub>, passes below the defined seabed depth, _z_<sub>_b_</sub>. The model is only active when a node contacts the seabed (i.e. when _z_<sub>_i_</sub> ≤ _z_<sub>_b_</sub>).

The total equation of motion for each node along a mooring line, accounting for the terms already mentioned along with node mass (matrix **m**<sub>**node**,_i_</sub>), and submerged weight (**W**<sub>**sub**,_i_</sub>), is then 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/AzaesNF.png"/> (100)
</p>

This three-by-three matrix equation is solved for each node within a constant-time-step second-order Runge-Kutta integrator.

With its simple formulation, MoorDyn has shown to be computationally efficient and reliable for common offshore renewable energy mooring scenarios, typically giving accurate results with discretizations in the order of 20 segments per mooring line ([Hall and Goupee, 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801815002279); Vissio et al., 2015; Sirnivas et al., 2016). Finer discretizations are usually only necessary when transients emerge in the seabed contact forces due to individual nodes touching down abruptly. 

Information on using MoorDyn is available in the [MoorDyn Users Guide](http://www.matt-hall.ca/files/MoorDyn%20Users%20Guide%202017-08-16.pdf).

### 3.14.2 Two-way coupling DualSPHysics-MoorDyn

Fundamentally, coupling MoorDyn with other codes is based on a loose coupling approach in which fairlead kinematics are passed to MoorDyn, the mooring system dynamics are calculated for one or more time steps, and then the resulting fairlead tension vectors are transferred back to the other simulation code used for the coupling. 

The coupling between DualSPHysics and the MoorDyn library can split into three steps:

1<sup>st</sup>) the motions and rotations initially solved in DualSPHysics (**V**, **Ω**, **R**<sub>**0**</sub>) are passed to MoorDyn and used as input for the mooring line fairlead kinematics;

2<sup>nd</sup>) MoorDyn solves the mooring line behaviour during the time step used in the DualSPHysics model, namely MoorDyn updates the position of the segments of the mooring line and computes the forces at the fairlead connections (_d_**V**/_dt_, _d_**Ω**/_dt_), which are transferred back to DualSPHysics;

3<sup>rd</sup>) the extra forces calculated in the second step are added in DualSPHysics to obtain the final resulting force acting onto the floating structure that is used to compute the final motions and rotations of the floating structure. 

The computational cost of MoorDyn at each time step is negligible compared to the execution time needed to solve one time step in the SPH model.

<p align="center">
<strong>Figure 3-8.</strong> Flow chart of the coupling between DualSPHysics and MoorDyn.
</p>

The work of [Domínguez et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2019.103560) included more details about this coupling and a complete validation comparing numerical values with experimental data. Overall, the results demonstrate the accuracy of the coupling between DualSPHysics and MoorDyn to simulate the motion of a moored floating structure under the action of regular waves in terms of free-surface elevation, motions of the floater and mooring tensions.
 
Going forward, this modelling approach can be employed to simulate more complex floating structures such as floating wind turbines, buoys, WECs, offshore platforms, etc.


## 3.15 Open boundary conditions

Several types of boundary conditions are available in DualSPHysics to simulate a variety of engineering scenarios. Some examples are the Dynamic Boundary Particles [(Crespo et al. 2015)](http://www.techscience.com/doi/10.3970/cmc.2007.005.173.pdf), SPH-DEM coupling [(Canelas et al. 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2016.01.006), and Periodic Open Boundary Conditions [(Gomez-Gesteira et al. 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.02.029). Nevertheless, none of these formulations is appropriate when the computational problem requires specific flow conditions to be enforced at the domain boundaries. The classic example of flow past an object is one of such cases, where usually an inflow velocity needs to be prescribed at the inlet while other velocity or pressure conditions can be either prescribed or extracted from the fluid domain at the outlet. The treatment of open boundary conditions in SPH is an active area of study among SPH researchers and falls within one of the [SPHERIC Grand Challenges](http://spheric-sph.org/grand-challenges). The work of several authors in the literature provides a number of choices to model open boundaries with both WCSPH and ISPH, see for example [Ferrand et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2016.09.009), [Federico et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euromechflu.2012.02.002), [Lastiwka et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.1971), and [Vacondio et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000543).

To address this issue in DualSPHysics, an open boundary algorithm has been implemented based on the work presented in [Tafuni et al. 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303466851_Open_boundary_conditions_for_large-scale_SPH_simulations), [Tafuni et al. 2017](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315493976_Accurate_and_efficient_SPH_open_boundary_conditions_for_real_3-D_engineering_problems) and [Tafuni et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2018.08.004). Figure 3-9 summarizes the working principles of the algorithm in the generic case of a fluid flowing near a buffer area identifying an open boundary. The innermost dashed curve represents the buffer threshold boundary, i.e. the fluid-buffer interface, followed by a layer of SPH particles used to enforce certain boundary conditions. The buffer width is chosen to equal or exceed the kernel radius so to ensure full kernel support for the fluid particles in the near proximity of an inlet or outlet.

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>Figure 3-9.</strong> Sketch of the implemented open boundary model adapted from Tafuni et al. 2018.
</p>

Two ways of providing the information to an open boundary are considered: physical quantities are either assigned a priori or passed from the fluid domain to the buffer zones (inflow and outflow) using ghost nodes. A similar idea was used by [Marrone et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2013.03.011) to enforce closed boundary conditions. The position of the ghost nodes is obtained by mirroring the normal distance of the boundary particles from the permeable surface into the fluid. In order to calculate fluid quantities at the ghost nodes, a standard particle interpolation would not be consistent due to the proximity of these points to an open boundary, which translates into the lack of a full kernel support. The method proposed by [Liu and Liu 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnum.2005.02.012) is thereby adopted to retrieve first order kernel and particle consistency. The multi-dimensional first-order Taylor series approximation of the field function <i>f</i>(<strong>x</strong>) multiplied by the kernel function, <i>W</i><sub>k</sub>(<strong>x</strong>), and its first order derivatives, <i>W</i><sub>k,B</sub>(<strong>x</strong>), is given by

<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CLVzb6K.png" width="600" /> (102)
</p>

Beta is an index going from 1 to <i>d</i>, the total number of dimensions. Equations (101, 102) form a system of <i>d</i> + 1 equations in <i>d</i> + 1 unknowns, i.e. <i>f</i><sub>k</sub> and f<sub>k,B</sub>. Using particle notation, the approximations of <i>f</i><sub>k</sub> and <i>f</i><sub>k,B</sub> translate into matrix equations that give the values of f<sub>k</sub> and f<sub>k,B</sub>, calculated as:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TLj0ydO.png" width="600" /> (103)
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4h1AMcd.png" width="600" /> (104)
</p>

The above are finally used to calculate the value of <i>f</i><sub>o</sub> at the open boundary (more details are shown in [Tafuni et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2018.08.004).) 

Figures 3-10 – 3-12 further elucidate the working principles of the open boundary algorithm. To define the reference permeable boundary for the placement of buffer particles and ghost nodes, a series of fixed points is created along a user-defined curve in 2-D or surface in 3-D. Buffer particles are created along the normal direction to the permeable boundary, starting from the fixed points and only for depths below the defined water level. The latter can be either user-defined or extrapolated from the ghost nodes using a procedure similar to that of the shifting algorithm presented in [Lind et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2011.10.027). Buffer particles adjacent to the fluid domain are generated at half the particle spacing <i>dp</i> from the fixed points, while other are positioned multiples of <i>dp</i> away.

<p align="center">
<strong>Figure 3-12.</strong> Sketch of the change in liquid depth in the buffer area. As depth is increased by the user or from knowledge of the free-surface elevation inside the fluid domain, new particles (light yellow) are created to fill the buffer area.
</p>

As shown on the bottom left of Figure 3-11, when a buffer particle crosses the permeable boundary it becomes a fluid particle and simultaneously a new boundary particle is initialized in the buffer. The process is similar in reverse, that is, when a fluid particle crosses a permeable boundary it becomes a buffer particle and follows the flow conditions specified in the buffer. In this case there is no creation of new particles following this transition. Finally, when a buffer particle crosses the domain edge it is discarded from the computational space, with its properties frozen for the remainder of the simulation. 
Changes in liquid depth are tackled by the algorithm as follows: the maximum height of the buffer particles is determined by the highest fixed point, while the water level can be either imposed by the user or extrapolated from the ghost nodes. In either cases, only buffer particles below the water level are activated and participate in the fluid-buffer and buffer-fluid interactions.
In addition to the more general use of the buffer particles, the new algorithm allows:
* Variable Velocity and Pressure Profiles: Unsteady velocity and pressure profiles and/or pressure and velocity gradients along a given direction can now be assigned in buffer areas.
* Variable Water Depth: The water depth can be either predefined or extrapolated from the fluid.
* Backflow: This last option is related to the previous two and allows flow reversion in a buffer.

## 3.16 Two-phase liquid-gas

Liquid-gas flows with mixing and violent free-surface hydrodynamic interaction exist in various industrial and research fields such as coastal and nuclear engineering. They include a diverse range of problems such as overturning or breaking waves and multi-phase pipe flow and are an ideal application of SPH. 
To address these problems, DualSPHysics includes the multi-phase model presented in [Mokos et al., 2016]. This guide only provides a concise depiction of the multi-phase liquid-gas model implemented in the code.

The SPH formulation is based on the work of [Colagrossi and Landrini, 2003] and [Nugent and Posh, 2000] and its implementation on a GPU is relatively straightforward [Mokos et al., 2015]. The multi-phase model uses a modified version of Tait’s equation of state [Batchelor, 1974] (the same equation used in single-phase DualSPHysics) for incompressible and inviscid fluids:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yjprpMJ.png"/> (105)
</p>

where γ is the isentropic expansion factor, ρ0 is the initial density of the fluid, cs is the speed of sound, X signifies a constant background pressure, while the last term represents the cohesion forces between the particles of a single phase. As proposed by [Nugent and Posh, 2000] and [Mokos et al., 2015], the coefficient is based on the properties of the different phases and a characteristic length scale of the problem, L

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nxp4yD9.png"/> (106)
</p>

where ρw  and ρa  are the initial densities of the two phases (water and air in this case).

The variationally consistent forms of the velocity divergence and pressure gradient  used in single-phase DualSPHysics are used to update the continuity and momentum equations for the liquid phase. For the gas phase, the same SPH formulation is not applicable due to the large density discontinuity at the interface [Colagrossi and Landrini, 2003]. An extra term for the cohesion forces in the momentum equation for the lighter phase is required [Nugent and Posh, 2000]

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nb5BdyK.png"/> (107)
</p>

When using high resolutions, made possible by the use of GPUs, a numerical inconsistency has emerged for gas-liquid simulations. In violent flows unphysical voids and phase separation occur ultimately leading to numerical instability. New Fickian-based particle shifting algorithms with a selectively activated free-surface correction have been developed to prevent the creation of unnatural voids and maintain numerical stability through nearly uniform distributions [Mokos et al., 2016].

The Fickian shifting algorithm is a modified version of the one developed by [Lind et al., 2012] and described in Section 3.6. The particle concentration C is estimated here using the sum of the smoothing kernel.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kwg0tL7.png"/> (108)
</p>

The gradient of the particle concentration can be found using a standard SPH gradient approximation through the smoothing kernel [Monaghan, 2005; Violeau and Rogers, 2016]

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/q47AJzc.png"/> (109)
</p>

To evaluate the diffusion coefficient, the approach proposed by [Skillen et al., 2013] is used, shown in Eq. 26. A different approach is used for shifting near the free surface. The concentration gradient near the surface is controlled using the local tangent and normal vectors at the free surface [Lind et al., 2012]

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bGlCezn.png"/> (110)
</p>

where s and n are the tangent and normal vectors to the free surface in 2D, while βn is a reference concentration gradient (usually taken as the initial value). The parameter αn limits the diffusion in the direction normal to the free surface; for violent flows, such as the ones simulated in this article, αn is set equal to 0. However, for long slow flows, such as standing gravity waves, errors can potentially accumulate at the free surface due to the incompleteness of the kernel [Lind et al., 2012]. A small degree of diffusion at the normal direction is then allowed with the parameter αn set equal to 0.1.

For 3-D cases, the surface correction term needs to be slightly modified as Eq. 110 is only suitable for a two-dimensional simulation. For a 3-D case, the bi-tangent vector, b, also needs to be taken into consideration which allows shifting only on the tangent, s, and bi-tangent directions, treating the normal direction in the same way as the two-dimensional implementation

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wGM1UCU.png"/> (111)
</p>

where b is a unit vector orthogonal to s and n. In both 2-D and 3-D, the free surface is identified using the method of [Lee et al., 2008], Eq. 27.

The free surface term is only applied in the liquid phase. It was found to have a significant effect on the evolution of the flow, restricting the flow expansion on the free-surface. This is an undesirable effect for the gas phase, which should be expanding freely, so the term is not applied there.

For slower flows, in which the Eötvös number has a value close or smaller than 1, a surface tension formulation has been included. The method uses the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model [Brackbill et al., 1992] and the SPH implementation by [Hu and Adams, 2006] 

The Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model uses the curvature of the surface to compute the surface force per unit interfacial area FS

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oYM9YFN.png"/> (112)
</p>

where σ is the fluid surface tension coefficient of phase k, κ is the curvature, and n ̂ is the unit normal to the surface. Due to the difficulty in computing the curvature, [Lafaurie et al., 1994] proposed expressing the surface force as a tensor Π

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JlAUsS9.png"/> (113)
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/x4Wg9yC.png"/> (114)
</p>

The model was further simplified by [Wu et al., 1998] who suggested using a colour function instead of calculating the surface normal. The colour function is defined as following for a particle belonging to phase k and does not change throughout the computation

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9ZXkz4e.png"/> (115)
</p>

The colour function SPH gradient [Hu and Adams, 2006] exists only if there are neighbouring particles of phase l where l is a different phase from k

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cPwMhbr.png"/> (116)
</p>

Using the colour gradient, the surface tension tensor can be computed and through that, the surface tension force, used in the momentum equation as an external force

## 3.17 Rheology models and non-Newtonian formulations

The rheology of materials such as polymers, slurries, pastes and suspensions are a frequent occurrence in industrial applications and academic research. These materials are usually (but not necessarily) characterized by a yield stress below which the material has not yielded and does not flow. Further, the shear strain to shear stress relationship may not be linear as with Newtonian fluids. In general, fluids which do not obey the Newton law of viscosity may be classified as non-Newtonian fluids with viscoelastic, time dependant viscosity and non-Newtonian viscosity. 

In DualSPHysics the generalized Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou (HBP) model has been implemented following the work of [Fourtakas and Rogers 2016] on liquid-sediment two-phase flows. The Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou model is capable of modelling a wide range of viscoplastic materials such as Bingham plastic, Bingham pseudoplastic and dilatant fluids. Further, the HBP generalised non-Newtonian model can be used to model shear thinning or thickening materials in the absence of yield strength.  

The constitutive equation for the HBP model is written as,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Um2AH2c.png" width="120px"/> (119)   
</p>

where <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\vec{\tau&space;}" title="\vec{\tau }" /> is the shear stress tensor, derivative of <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dot{\gamma&space;}" title="\dot{\gamma }" /> is the symmetric shear rate tensor given by,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IC0WFPG.png" width="160px"/> (120)  
</p>

with <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\small&space;\nabla{\mathbf{v}}" title="\small \nabla{\mathbf{v}}" /> and <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\small&space;\nabla{\mathbf{v}^{T}}" title="\small \nabla{\mathbf{v}^{T}}" /> the velocity and transpose respectively and _η_<sub>_app_</sub> is the apparent viscosity,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/56lz9oF.png" width="270px"/> (121)   
</p>

In the above _τ_<sub>_y_</sub> is the yield stress of the fluid, _μ_ is the viscosity (or consistency index usually denoted by _K_), _n_ is the power law index (commonly referred to as the Herschel-Bulkley parameter) and _m_ the exponential shear rate growth parameter (or Papanastasiou parameter) and the magnitude of the symmetric strain rate tensor is defined as,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZHrISxo.png" width="270px"/> (122)  
</p>

The Papanastasiou parameter controls the growth of the stress with a finite value for small shear rates in the unyielded region and linear behaviour in the yielded region. Figure 3-13(a) shows the initial rapid growth of stress by varying _m_ whereas Figure 3-13(b) shows the effect of the power law index _n_.

Note that as _m_ → ∞ the HBP model reduces to the original Herschel-Bulkley model and when _n_ = 1 the model reduces to a simple Bingham model. Consequently, when _n_ = 1 and _m_ = 0 the model reduces to a Newtonian fluid. 

Note that, the HBP model does not exhibit a discontinuity at zero shear rates in contrast with a pure Bingham model which is usually modelled using a bi-viscosity model.

where the brackets denote an SPH approximation. Two formulations are available in the multi-phase non-Newtonian formulation for the discretization of the viscous forces. The first uses the formulation of [Morris et al., 1997] that reads,

where _v_<sub>_app_</sub> is the apparent kinematic viscosity. The second formulation takes advantage of the conservative gradient operator in SPH form such as the viscous forces are discretised by,

The continuity equation (13) has the additional terms of the density ratios of the interpolating and neighbouring particles, allowing different densities to be used in each phase of the system and is written as,

For the discretisation of the shear stress tensor and velocity gradients of eq. 120, a finite differences approach or an SPH gradient summation can be used. The former reads

whereas the later takes the following form,

In this implementation, any combination of viscous operators and gradients is allowed in the multi-phase non-Newtonian DualSPHysics formulation. More information about the multi-phase non-Newtonian formulation can be found in [Fourtakas and Rogers 2016].

Future, implementations include a sediment phase with yielded and unyielded sediment regions as described in the aforementioned manuscript.
