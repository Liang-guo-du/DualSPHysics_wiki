Some demonstration cases are included in the DualSPHysics package (Figure 12.1); such as a dam break interacting with an obstacle in a tank, waves on a beach created by a piston or the real geometry of a pump mechanism that translates water within a storage tank.

The different test cases are described in the following sections. The scripts (.bat in Windows and .sh in Linux) are presented and the different command line instructions to execute the different programs are described. The XML files are also explained in detail to describe the execution parameters and the different labels to plot boundaries, fluid volumes, movements, etc. 

For each case there are 4 options; 
wCase_win64_CPU.bat (windows on CPU)
wCase_win64_GPU.bat (windows on GPU)
xCase_linux64_CPU.sh (linux on CPU)
xCase_linux64_GPU.sh (linux on GPU)

Since many 3-D applications can be reduced to a 2-D problem, the executable of DualSPHysics can also perform 2-D simulations, however this option is not fully optimized. A 2-D simulation can be achieved easily by imposing the same values in the Y-direction (<pointmin> = <pointmax> in the input XML file). For example, see the two-dimensional 01_DamBreak indicated in Figure 12-2. Thus, the initial configuration is a 2-D system and DualSPHysics will detect automatically that the simulation must be carried out using the 2-D formulation.

## 12.1 DAMBREAK

A 2-D dam break can be executed using wCaseDambreakVal2D_win64_GPU.bat (xCaseDambreakVal2D_linux64_GPU.sh in linux), which is the file that summarises the tasks to be carried out using the different codes in a given order:

Figure 12-2 shows different instants of the CaseDambreakVal2D simulation. The left frames show the PartFluid_xxxx.vtk (computed with PartVTK) and the right ones show the Slices_xxxx.vtk (obtained with IsoSurface)

With this example, the experimental data of [Koshizuka and Oka, 1996] can be numerically reproduced. The file EXP_X-DamTipPosition_Koshizula&Oka1996.txt includes the X-position of the tip of the dam for several instants (before the impact with the other wall).  

Numerical gauges (<gauges>) allows the user to compute different magnitudes during the execution of DualSPHysics. In this case, two gauges were created at x=0.2 to compute the water column height evolution and at z=0.03 to compute the X-position of the tip of the dam. The gauges can be also observed in the right panel of Figure 12-2.

The 3-D test case consists of a dam-break flow impacting with a structure inside a numerical tank. No moving boundary particles are involved in this simulation and no movement is defined. This case is executed using wCaseDambreak_win64_GPU.bat (xCaseDambreak_linux64_GPU.sh in linux),

Different instants of the CaseDambreak simulation are shown in Figure 12-3 where the PartFluid_xxxx.vtk of the fluid particles, the CaseDambreak_Box_Dp.vtk and CaseDambreak_Building_Dp.vtk are depicted.

Using MeasureTool code, numerical velocities have been computed in the list of points described in the file CaseDambreak_PointsVelocity.txt, which are (0.754, 0.31, 0.02), (0.754, 0.31, 0.04) and (0.754, 0.31, 0.06) using information of fluid particles within the kernel interaction. Numerical values of Vx-velocity in the x-direction are shown in Figure 12-4 for these three points.

Pressure values are also computed using MeasureTool in the list of points described in the file CaseDambreak_PointsPressure.txt, which corresponds to locations in the front wall of the structure (Figure 12-5) using information of fluid particles within the kernel interaction. Due to the use of the dynamic boundaries, probes used for measuring quantities should not be placed at the exact position of boundary particles. The forces exerted by the boundary particles create a small gap between them and fluid particles (1.5 times h); as a result, probes placed inside the gap will have a reduced fluid particle population and will produce either an incorrect or no result. To avoid this issue, it is proposed that probes are placed at a distance 1.5h from the boundary positions.

In this example, the PointsPressure_Incorrect probes are placed at the exact position as the boundary particles at the building, while the PointsPressure_Correct probes are placed at a distance of 1.5h (for the default conditions and parameters of the case) from the boundaries. The first probes produce no pressure results as the number of fluid particles for the interpolation is too small, while the second shows the pressure impact by the water flow.

Note that the probes are not automatically associated with the smoothing length h and their position has to be changed manually if the resolution changes. Also, note that by increasing resolution (i.e. using a smaller “dp”) the gap is reduced.
 
Figure 12-6 shows the pressure computed at the correct numerical probes.

This case also shows how to compute forces exerted against a structure. In this way the force is computed using ComputeForces as the summation of the acceleration values of the boundary particles that form the front wall of the structure (mk=21) multiplied by mass. Figure 12-7 shows the time series of the numerical force.

In fact, the methodology outlined here was used in for the validation of DualSPHysics presented in [Crespo et al. (2011)].

Finally, an example to use FlowTool is also available in CaseDambreak. Two different domains are defined in the text file CaseDambreak_FileBoxes.txt. Figure 12-8 shows the red domain (RESERVOIR) where the water reservoir was initially created and the green box (TANK) to compute the flow rate in front of the obstacle.  The output VTK files named Boxes_xxxx.vtk are also depicted in Figure 12-8 and the colour corresponds to the domain to which they belong.

FlowTool also creates a CSV file, named ResultFlow.csv. Hence, figure 12-9 represents the outflow of the red domain and the inflow into the green one.

## 12.2 PERIODICITY
This testcase is an example of periodicity applied to 2-D case where particles that leave the domain through the right wall are introduced through the left wall with the same properties but where the vertical position can change (with an increase of +0.3 in Z-position). wCasePeriodicity.bat (xCasePeriodicity.sh in linux) file summarises the tasks to be carried out using the different codes.

Different instants of the CasePeriodicity simulation are shown in Figure 12-10 where the PartFluid_xxxx.vtk of the fluid particles and the CasePeriodicity_Bound.vtk are depicted.

## 12.3 MOVINGSQUARE

A 2-D case without gravity is simulated. A square box is moving with uniform velocity (<mvrect>) inside the numerical tank – see SPHERIC Benchmark #2. Gravity is set to zero, which means that parameter “b” cannot be automatically computed following equation of state (Eq. 14) and needs to be specified in <constantsdef> (<b value="1.1200e+05" auto="false" />).  The value of “b” is chosen to ensure that the speed of sound, cs, is at least 10 times the maximum particle velocity to maintain weak compressibility, that is vmax, cs ≥ 10 vmax.  Shifting is used for this internal flow to prevent the appearance of voids in the fluid. The case can be also executed without applying shifting to observe the problem of the voids.
wCaseMovingSquare.bat (xCaseMovingSquare.sh in linux) file summarises the tasks to be carried out using the different codes. The same case but without using shifting can be also executed to observe how the voids behind the moving object are not avoided if shifting is not applied.

Different instants of the CaseMovingSquare simulation are shown in Figure 12-11 where the PartFluid_xxxx.vtk of the fluid particles and the Square_xxxx.vtk are depicted.
