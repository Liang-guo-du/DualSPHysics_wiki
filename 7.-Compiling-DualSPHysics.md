The code can be compiled for either CPU or CPU&GPU. Please note that both the C++ and CUDA version of the code contain the same features and options. Most of the source code is common to CPU and GPU, which allows the code to be run on workstations without a CUDA-enabled GPU, using only the CPU implementation.

To run DualSPHysics on a GPU using an executable, only an Nvidia CUDA-enabled GPU card is needed and the latest version of the GPU driver must be installed. However, to compile the source code, the GPU programming language CUDA and nvcc compiler must be installed on your computer. CUDA Toolkit X.X can be downloaded from Nvidia website [http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-XX](http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-XX). CUDA versions from 4.0 till 9.2 have been tested.

Once the C++ compiler (for example gcc) and the CUDA compiler (nvcc) have been installed in your machine, you can download the relevant files from the directory **DualSPHysics_v4.4/src**.

## Windows compilation
In **DualSPHysics_v4.4/src** there are also several folders:
* source: contains all the source files;
* lib/vs2013 & lib/vs2015: precompiled libraries for x64 (debug and release);
* VS: includes the project file _DualSPHysics4Re_vs2015.sln_ is provided to be opened with Visual Studio Community 2015.

Different configurations can be chosen for compilation:
a) Release: for CPU and GPU 
b) ReleaseCPU: only for CPU 

The result of the compilation is the executable _DualSPHysics4.4_win64.exe_ or _DualSPHysics4.4CPU_win64.exe_ created in **DualSPHysics_v4.4/bin/windows**. The GPU codes were compiled for compute capabilities sm30, sm35, sm50, sm52 sm61, sm70 and with CUDA v9.2.

The Visual Studio project is created including the libraries for OpenMP in the executable. To not include them, user can modify _Props config -> C/C++ -> Language -> OpenMp_ and compile again. The use of OpenMP can be also deactivated by commenting the code line `#define OMP_USE` in **OmpDefs.h. **
 
In order to simulate more than 2000 and up to 65000 floating or solid objects, the user should activate or comment the code line `#define CODE_SIZE4` in **Types.h**.

## Linux compilation
As mentioned before, in **DualSPHysics_v4.4/src** there are also several folders:
* source: contains all the source files and makefiles;
* lib/linux_gcc: precompiled libraries for GCC;

Makefiles can be used to compile the code in linux:
* make –f **Makefile**: full compilation just using make command
* make –f **Makefile_cpu**: only for CPU
  
The result of the compilation is the executable _DualSPHysics4.4_linux64_ or _DualSPHysics4.4CPU_linux64_ created in ****DualSPHysics_v4.4/bin/linux****.

To exclude the use of OpenMP you have to remove the flags `–fopenmp` and `-lgomp` in the Makefile and comment line `#define OMP_USE` in **OmpDefs.h**.
In order to simulate more than 2000 and up to 65000 floating or solid objects, the user should activate or comment the code line `#define CODE_SIZE4` in **Types.h**.

You can see the content of the makefile [here](https://github.com/DualSPHysics/DualSPHysics/blob/master/src/source/Makefile)

The user can modify the compilation options, the path of the CUDA toolkit directory, the GPU architecture. The GPU code is already compiled (EXECS) for compute capabilities sm30, sm35, sm50, sm52 sm61, sm70 and with CUDA v9.2.

Note that if you are using a GCC version greater than v4.9 you should set the `"USE_GCC5"` option to `"YES"` to avoid compatibility issues during the compilation.

### Alternative building method via CMAKE
A new building method is supported since the version 4.0 of DualSPHysics using CMAKE ([https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)). CMAKE is a cross-platform and an independent building system for compilation. This software generates native building files (like makefiles or Visual Studio projects) for any platform. The location of dependencies and the needed flags are automatically determined.

**Compile instructions for Microsoft Windows with Cmake**:
The building system needs the following dependencies:
* Cmake version 2.8.10 or greater ([https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/))
* Nvidia CUDA Toolkit version 4.0 or higher.
* Visual Studio 2013 or 2015 version.
* File “CMakeLists.txt” in **src/source**.

The folder **build** will be created in **src/source**. This folder will contain the building files so it can be safely removed in case of rebuilding, it can actually be placed anywhere where the user has writing permissions.
Afterwards, open the Cmake application, a new window will appear:

Paste the **Source** folder path in the textbox labelled as **Where is the source code**, and paste the build folder path into the **Where to build the binaries** textbox. Once the paths are introduced, the **Configure** button should be pressed. A new dialog will appear asking for the compiler to be used in the project. Please, remember that only Visual Studio 2013 and Visual Studio 2015 for 64 bit are supported.

If the configuration succeeds, now press the **Generate** button. This will generate a Visual Studio project file into the **build** directory. 
In order to compile both CPU and GPU versions, just change configuration to **Release** and compile. If the user only wants to compile one version, one can choose one of the solutions **DualSPHysics4.4CPU** or **DualSPHysics4.4** for CPU or GPU versions respectively, and compile it.

The user can freely customize the **src/source/CMakeLists.txt** file to add new source files or any other modifications. For more information about how to edit this file, please, refer to official Cmake documentation ([https://cmake.org/documentation/](https://cmake.org/documentation/)).

**Compile instructions for Linux with Cmake**

The building system needs the following dependencies:
* Cmake version 2.8.10 or higher.
* Nvidia CUDA Toolkit version 4.0 or higher.
* GNU G++ compiler 4.4 version or higher.
* File “CMakeLists.txt” in **src/source**.

The folder **build** will be created in **src/source**. This folder will contain the building files so it can be safely removed in case of rebuilding; it can actually be placed anywhere where the user has writing permissions. To create this folder and run Cmake just type the commands in bold shown below:

```
> cd src/source
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..

```

The command **cmake ..** will search for a Cmake file (**CMakeLists.txt**) in the specified folder. As mentioned before, the user can freely customize this file to add new source files or any other modifications. For more information about how to edit this file, please, refer to Cmake official documentation ([https://cmake.org/documentation/](https://cmake.org/documentation/)).

Once the cmake command runs without error, a Makefile can be found in the **build** folder. To build both CPU and GPU versions of DualSPHysics just type **make**. If the user only needs to build one of the executable files he can use the commands **make DualSPHysics4.4CPU** or **make DualSPHysics4.4** for CPU and GPU versions respectively.
In order to install the compiled binaries into the **bin** folder, the user can either copy the executable files or type the command **make install**.
