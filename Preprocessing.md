A program named GenCase is included to define the initial configuration of the
simulation, movement description of moving objects and the parameters of the
execution in DualSPHysics. All this information is contained in a definition input file
in XML format; Case_Def.xml. Two output files are created after running GenCase:
Case.xml and Case.bi4 (the input files for DualSPHysics code). These input (red
boxes) and output files (blue boxes) can be observed in Figure 9-1. Case.xml contains
all the parameters of the system configuration and its execution such as key variables
(smoothing length, reference density, gravity, coefficient to calculate pressure, speed of
sound...), the number of particles in the system, movement definition of moving
boundaries and properties of moving bodies. Case.bi4 contains the initial state of the
particles (number of particles, position, velocity and density) in BINX4 (.bi4) format.

Particle geometries created with GenCase can be initially checked by visualising in
Paraview the files Case_All.vtk, Case_Bound.vtk and Case_Fluid.vtk.

GenCase employs a 3-D Cartesian mesh to locate particles. The idea is to build any
object using particles. These particles are created at the nodes of the 3-D Cartesian
mesh. Firstly, the mesh nodes around the object are defined and then particles are
created only in the nodes needed to draw the desired geometry. Figure 9-2 illustrates
how this mesh is used; in this case a triangle is generated in 2D. First the nodes of a
mesh are defined starting from the maximum dimensions of the desired triangle, then
the edges of the triangle are defined and finally particles are created at the nodes of the
Cartesian mesh which are inside the triangle.

All particles are placed over a regular Cartesian grid. The geometry of the case is
defined independently to the inter-particle distance. This allows the discretization of
each test case with a different number of particles simply by varying the resolution (or
particle size) dp. Furthermore, GenCase is very fast and able to generate millions of
particles only in seconds on the CPU.

Very complex geometries can be easily created since a wide variety of commands
(labels in the XML file) are available to create different objects; points, lines, triangles,
quadrilateral, polygons, pyramids, prisms, boxes, beaches, spheres, ellipsoids, cylinders,
waves (`<drawpoint />, <drawpoints />, <drawline />, <drawlines />, <drawtriangle />,
<drawquadri />, <drawtrianglesstrip />, <drawtrianglesfan />, <drawpolygon>, <drawtriangles />,
<drawpyramid />, <drawprism />, <drawbox />, <drawbeach />, <drawsphere />, <drawellipsoid
/>, <drawcylinder />, <drawwave />`).

Once the mesh nodes that represent the desired object are selected, these points are
stored as a matrix of nodes. The shape of the object can be transformed using a
translation (`<move />`), a scaling (`<scale />` ) or a rotation (`<rotate />, <rotateline />`). With the
generation process creating particles at the nodes, different types of particles can be
created; a fluid particle (`<setmkfluid />`), a boundary particle (` <setmkbound />`) or none
(`<setmkvoid />`). Hence, mk is the marker value used to mark a set of particles with a
common feature in the simulation. Note that values of the final mk are different to
mkfluid, mkbound and mkvoid following the rules:

mk for boundaries = mkbound + 11

mk for fluid particles = mkfluid + 1

Particles can be created only at the object surface (`<setdrawmode mode="face" />`), or only
inside the bounds of the objects (`<setdrawmode mode="solid" />`) or both (`<setdrawmode
mode="full" />`).

The set of fluid particles can be labelled with features or special behaviours ( `<initials />`).
For example, initial velocity (`<velocity />`) can be imposed for fluid particles or a solitary
wave can be defined ( `<velwave />`). Furthermore, particles can be defined as part offloating object (`<floatings />`).

Once boundaries are defined, filling a region with fluid particles can be easily obtained
using the following commands: (`<fillpoint />, <fillbox />, <fillfigure />, <fillprism />`). This
works also in the presence of arbitrarily complex geometries.

In cases with more complex geometries, external objects can be imported from 3DS
files (Figure 9-3) or CAD files (Figure 9-4). This enables the use of realistic geometries
generated by 3D designing application with the drawing commands of GenCase to be
combined. These files (3DS or CAD) must be converted to STL format (`<drawfilestl />`),
PLY format (`<drawfileply />`) or VTK format (`<drawfilevtk />`), formats that are easily
loaded by GenCase. Any object in STL, PLY or VTK (object.vtk, object.stl or
object.ply in Figure 9-1) can be split in different triangles and any triangle can be
converted into particles using the GenCase code.

Different kinds of movements can be imposed to a set of particles; linear, rotational,
circular, sinusoidal, etc. To help users define movements, a directory with some
examples is also included in the DualSPHysics package. Thus, the directory MOTION
includes:

* Motion01: uniform rectilinear motion (`<mvrect />`) that also includes pauses ( `<wait />`)
* Motion02: combination of two uniform rectilinear motion ( `<mvrect />`)
* Motion03: movement of an object depending on the movement of another (hierarchy
of objects)
* Motion04: accelerated rectilinear motion (`<mvrectace />`)
* Motion05: rotational motion (`<mvrot />`). See Figure 9-5.
* Motion06: accelerated rotation motion (`<mvrotace />`) and accelerated circular motion
(`<mvcirace />`). See Figure 9-6.
* Motion07: sinusoidal movement (`<mvrectsinu />, <mvrotsinu />, <mvcirsinu />`)
* Motion08: prescribed with data from an external file (time , position) (`<mvfile/>`)
* Motion09: prescribed with data from an external file (time , angle) (`<mvrotfile />`)
