* Definition of variables in the XML file that makes easier the particle generation of complex cases
* Computation of normal vectors for boundary particles (to be used with new boundary conditions)
* Option to create several layers of particles (to be used with new boundary conditions)

**Novelties simulating fluid-driven objects**
* Problems dealing with objects of density very different from water are solved
* Floating objects can be combined with imposed lineal and angular velocity

**New SPH formulations**
* Density Diffusion Term (DDT) [Fourtakas et al. 2020]

**New functionalities in the coupling with [Project Chrono](https://projectchrono.org/)**
* Coulomb friction, Pulleys, Elastic collisions

**New rheology models, non-Newtonian formulations and multiphase flows**
* Velocity gradients calculated by a finite differences approach (FDA) or an SPH gradient
* Explicit calculation of shear rates and apparent viscosity for non-Newtonian fluids
* Viscous forces modelled by the [Morris et al. 1997] operator or the SPH deviatoric stress tensor
* Combination of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids (Newtonian, dilatant and pseudo-plastic) using the generalised Herschel–Bulkley-Papanastasiou model 
* Capable of modelling Power law, Bingham and any other non-linear fluid 
* Platform for implementation of any non-Newtonian formulation  
* Up to nine different phases per simulation

## New on DualSPHysics v4.4

**Coupling with [Project Chrono](https://projectchrono.org/) library**
* Collisions between solids (using restitution and friction coefficient)
* Realistic frictional behavior with a full Coulomb sliding/sticking/rolling model
* Large variety of mechanical constraints (joints, hinges and springs)
* Examples can be found in the subfolder **examples/chrono**

**Coupling with wave propagation models**
* Employing the multi-layered piston wavemaker (with [SWASH](http://swash.sourceforge.net/))
* Relaxation zone technique for wave and current generation
* Examples can be found in the subfolder **examples/wavecoupling**

**Open boundary conditions: inlet & outlet**
* A time- and/or space-dependent velocity field can be assigned at an open boundary
* The density at an open boundary can be either predefined (fixed and hydrostatic options available) or varied according to information retrieved from the adjacent fluid
* The water elevation at an open boundary can be either predefined (fixed and time-dependent options available) or varied according to information retrieved from the adjacent fluid
* The buffer areas are built to allow dual inlet/outlet behaviour
* Examples can be found in the subfolder **examples/inletoutlet**

**Wave generation**
* Automatic generation of single and multiple solitary waves
* Example can be found in **examples/main/16_SolitaryWaves**

**Novelties on post-processing tools**
* The **moment about an axis** can be now computed using ComputeForces.exe

**More help to produce XML input file**
* Several templates are now available in doc/xml_format
* New and more complete "XML_v4.4_GUIDE.pdf"

**Other changes**
* New definition of domain limits (simulationdomain)
* Numerical gauge during simulation (gauges)
* Easy way to restrain the motion (DOF) of floating bodies (**examples/others/FtRestrictions**)
