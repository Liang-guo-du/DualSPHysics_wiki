The main code which performs the SPH simulation is named **DualSPHysics**.

The **input files** to run DualSPHysics code include one XML file (**Case.xml** in Figure 10-1) and a binary file (**Case.bi4** in Figure 10-1). **Case.xml** contains all the parameters of the system configuration and its execution such as key variables (smoothing length, reference density, gravity, coefficients to compute pressure starting from density, speed of sound…), the number of particles in the system, movement definition of moving boundaries and properties of moving bodies. The binary file **Case.bi4** contains the particle data; arrays of position, velocity and density and headers. The **output files** consist of; i) binary format files with the particle information at different instants of the simulation (**Part0000.bi4, Part0001.bi4, Part0002.bi4** …), ii) file with excluded particles (**PartOut.obi4**), iii) file with basic information to execute the post-processing tools (**Part_Head.ibi4**), iv) file with information of the floating objects (**PartFloat.fbi4**), and v) text file with execution log (**Run.out**).

Different parameters defined in the XML file can be be changed using executions parameters of DualSPHysics: time stepping algorithm specifying Symplectic or Verlet (**`-symplectic, -verlet[:steps]`**), choice of kernel function which can be Cubic, Wendland or Gaussian (**`-cubic, -wendland, -gaussian`**), the value for artificial viscosity (**`-viscoart: <float>`**) or laminar+SPS viscosity treatment (**`-viscolamsps:<float>`**), activation of the Delta-SPH formulation (**`-deltasph: <float>`**), use of shifting algorithm (**`-shifting: <mode>`**) the maximum time of simulation and time intervals to save the output data (**`-tmax:, -tout:`**). To run the code, it is also necessary to specify whether the simulation is going to run in CPU or GPU mode (**`-cpu, -gpu[:id]`**), the format of the output files (**`-sv:[formats,...], none, binx, ascii, vtk, csv`**), that summarises the execution process (**`-svres:<0/1>`**) with the computational time of each individual process (**`-svtimers:<0/1>`**). It is also possible to exclude particles as being out of limits according to prescribed minimum and maximum values of density (**`-rhopout:min:max`**) or that travel further than maximum Z position (**`-incz:<float>`**).

For CPU executions, a multi-core implementation using OpenMP enables executions in parallel using the different cores of the machine. It takes the maximum number of cores of the device by default or users can specify it (**`-ompthreads:<int>`**). On the other hand, different cell divisions of the domain can be used (**`-cellmode:<mode>`**) that differ in memory usage and efficiency. 

DualSPHysics uses double precision for variables of position of the particles (**`-posdouble:<mode>`**) for the computation of particle interactions. The particle interaction is one of the most time-consuming parts of the simulation, hence the precision in this part can be controlled using the **`-posdouble`** parameter, which takes the following values:
0: particle interaction is performed using single precision for position variables (_x, y, z_) 
When “dp” is much smaller than size of the domain, the user is recommended to choose one of the following:

1. particle interaction is performed using double precision for position variables but final position is stored using simple precision
2. particle interaction is performed using double precision for position variables and final position is stored using double precision.

An important novelty since v4.0 is the determination of the optimum BlockSize for the CUDA kernels that execute particle interaction (**`-blocksize:<mode>`**):
* Fixed (`-blocksize:0`): A fixed block size of 128 threads is used. This value does not always provide the maximum performance but it usually offers good performance for those type of kernels.
* Occupancy (`-blocksize:1`): Occupancy Calculator of CUDA is used to determine the optimum block size according to the features of the kernel (registers and shared memory, however data used in the kernels are not considered). This option is available from CUDA 6.5
* Empirical (`-blocksize:2`): Here, data used in the CUDA kernels is also considered. The optimum BlockSize is evaluated every certain number of steps (500 by default). In this way, block size can change during the simulation according to input data. 

Please, note that there are two versions of the DualSPHysics code:
* DualSPHysics4.2_win64.exe / DualSPHysics4.2_linux64
* DualSPHysics4.2CPU_win64.exe / DualSPHysics4.2CPU_linux64
The second one was compiled to be executed only on CPU, while the first one includes GPU or CPU execution.

## TO RUN DUALSPHYSICS: 
### example: `DualSPHysics Case [options]`
where _Case_ is the name of the input files (Case.xml & Case.bi4 as seen in Figure 10-1).

`$dualsphysics $dirout/$name $dirout -svres –cpu`
enables the simulation on the cpu, where $dirout is the directory with the file $name.bi4

`$dualsphysics $dirout/$name $dirout -svres –gpu`
enables the same simulation on the gpu.

`$dualsphysics $dirout/$name $dirout -svres –gpu –partbegin:69 dirbegin`
restarts the simulation from the time corresponding to files output Part0069.bi4 located in the directory dirbegin

The configuration of the execution is mostly defined in the XML file, but it can be also defined or changed using **execution parameters**. Furthermore, new options and possibilities for the execution can be imposed using **[options]**:
