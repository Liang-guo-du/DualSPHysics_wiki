• **New structure of package (now linux and windows in only one package)**

• **Multiphase code: LiquidGas**
* Source code and examples

• **New capacity to simulate up to 65,000 floating or moving bodies** 
* Pre-processing and post-processing tools are adapted to this
* Compiling option for this functionality

• **Wave generation and absorption**
* 2nd Order Stokes: piston and flap
* Passive absorption using sponge layers
* Active absorption: AWAS for piston

• **New test cases** (all can be visualised in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvCXgew5Ucs&list=PLwaIMU-iIzj2MnNs8w9nH0yluapkGh0jP)) 
* Poiseuille flow
* Many floating objects
* Dike with AWAS where overtopping is computed

• **New post-processing tools**
* FlowTool.exe; to compute inflow, outflow… overtopping!
* IsoSurface.exe; now also creates slices 

• **Graphical User Interface using FreeCAD** 
* DesignSPHysics: http://design.sphysics.org/ 

• **Advanced visualisation using Blender**
* VisualSPHysics: http://visual.sphysics.org/ 

• **Other changes**
* Several bugs are solved: shifting correction and others reported by users
* CUDA 9.2
* Visual Studio Community 2015 (free)
* Improvements in the code documentation (WIKI)
* Improved implementation of floating objects to facilitate coupling with other models
* New functionalities in the XML of GenCase to create more complex cases
* New output VTK file 1000 times less heavy to easily visualise huge cases

• **New license of the code: LGPL v2.1- GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**
* Software can be incorporated into both free software and proprietary software 
* Developers and companies can integrate LGPL software into their software without being required to release the source code of their own software-parts
* Libraries linked to DualSPHysics can be closed source
* LGPL can be used in commercial applications
