## 6.1 Pre-requisites Software needed before you compile

The code can be compiled for either CPU or CPU&GPU. 
You need to install the C++ compiler (for example gcc) and the CUDA compiler (nvcc).
Please note that both the C++ and CUDA version of the code contain the same features and options. Most of the source code is common to CPU and GPU, which allows the code to be run on workstations without a CUDA-enabled GPU, using only the CPU implementation.

To run DualSPHysics on a GPU using an executable, only an Nvidia CUDA-enabled GPU card is needed and the latest version of the GPU driver must be installed. However, to compile the source code, the GPU programming language CUDA and nvcc compiler must be installed on your computer. CUDA Toolkit X.X can be downloaded from Nvidia website [http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-XX](http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-XX). CUDA versions from 4.0 till 9.2 have been tested.


## 6.2 Location of the source code

The user can download the whole package from http://dual.sphysics.org/index.php/downloads/
The folder **src/source** contains the source files of v5.0 (.cpp, .cu and .h). 
The makefile of linux and the text file for CMAKE.txt are also included in this folder.
Visual studio (Community 2015) project for windows can be found in **src/VS**.
The libraries (.a and .lib) necessary for compilation are included in **src/lib**.

In addition the source code is also in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DualSPHysics/DualSPHysics). 
You can learn Git and GitHub using the [Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), which explains how to start a branch, write comments, and open a pull request.


## 6.3 Structure of the code

A complete list of these source files is summarised in Table 6-1. Some files are shared with other codes such as GenCase, BoundaryVTK, PartVTK, PartVTKOut, MeasureTool and IsoSurface. The rest of the files implement the SPH solver, some of them are used both for CPU/GPU executions and others are specific.

## 6.3.3 CPU Source files
The source file **JSphCpuSingle.cpp** can be better understood with the help of the diagram of calls represented in Figure 6-1. Note that particle interactions are not performed in terms of cells. In the current version each CPU thread computes all neighbour interactions of a set of particles that can belong to the same cell or not. The cell division of the domain is only used to look for neighbours in an efficient way.

When the Symplectic time integration scheme is used the step is split in predictor and corrector steps. Thus, Figure 6-2 shows the workflow and calls of the CPU code using this time scheme:

</p>

Note that _JSphCpu::Interaction_Forces_ performs the particle interaction in CPU using the template _InteractionForcesT_. Thus, the interaction between particles is carried out considering different parameters and considering the type of particles involved in the interaction as it can be seen in Figure 6-3 and Table 6-2:

## 6.3.4 GPU source files

The source file **JSphGpuSingle.cpp** can be better understood with the workflow represented in Figure 6-4 that includes the functions implemented in the GPU files. The dashed boxes indicate the CUDA kernels implemented in the CUDA files (_JSphGpu_ker.cu_).

## 6.4 Compiling on Windows using VisualStudio

In **DualSPHysics_v5.0/src** there are also several folders:
* source: contains all the source files;
* lib/vs2013 & lib/vs2015: precompiled libraries for x64 (debug and release);
* VS: includes the project file _DualSPHysics4Re_vs2015.sln_ is provided to be opened with Visual Studio Community 2015.

Different configurations can be chosen for compilation:
a) Release: for CPU and GPU 
b) ReleaseCPU: only for CPU 

The result of the compilation is the executable _DualSPHysics5.0_win64.exe_ or _DualSPHysics5.0CPU_win64.exe_ created in **DualSPHysics_v5.0/bin/windows**. The GPU codes were compiled for compute capabilities sm30, sm35, sm50, sm52 sm61, sm70 and with CUDA v9.2.

The Visual Studio project is created including the libraries for OpenMP in the executable. To not include them, user can modify _Props config -> C/C++ -> Language -> OpenMp_ and compile again. The use of OpenMP can be also deactivated by commenting the code line `#define OMP_USE` in **OmpDefs.h. **
 
In order to simulate more than 2000 and up to 65000 floating or solid objects, the user should activate or comment the code line `#define CODE_SIZE4` in **Types.h**.


## 6.5 Compiling on Linux

As mentioned before, in **DualSPHysics_v5.0/src** there are also several folders:
* source: contains all the source files and makefiles;
* lib/linux_gcc: precompiled libraries for GCC;

Makefiles can be used to compile the code in linux:
* make –f **Makefile**: full compilation just using make command
* make –f **Makefile_cpu**: only for CPU
  
The result of the compilation is the executable _DualSPHysics5.0_linux64_ or _DualSPHysics5.0CPU_linux64_ created in ****DualSPHysics_v4.4/bin/linux****.

To exclude the use of OpenMP you have to remove the flags `–fopenmp` and `-lgomp` in the Makefile and comment line `#define OMP_USE` in **OmpDefs.h**.
In order to simulate more than 2000 and up to 65000 floating or solid objects, the user should activate or comment the code line `#define CODE_SIZE4` in **Types.h**.

You can see the content of the makefile [here](https://github.com/DualSPHysics/DualSPHysics/blob/master/src/source/Makefile)

The user can modify the compilation options, the path of the CUDA toolkit directory, the GPU architecture. The GPU code is already compiled (bin) for compute capabilities sm30, sm35, sm50, sm52 sm61, sm70 and with CUDA v9.2.

Note that if you are using a GCC version greater than v4.9 you should set the `"USE_GCC5"` option to `"YES"` to avoid compatibility issues during the compilation.


## 6.6 Compiling using CMAKE

A new building method is supported since the version 4.0 of DualSPHysics using CMAKE ([https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)). CMAKE is a cross-platform and an independent building system for compilation. This software generates native building files (like makefiles or Visual Studio projects) for any platform. The location of dependencies and the needed flags are automatically determined.

**Compile instructions for Microsoft Windows with Cmake**:
The building system needs the following dependencies:
* Cmake version 2.8.10 or greater ([https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/))
* Nvidia CUDA Toolkit version 4.0 or higher.
* Visual Studio 2013 or 2015 version.
* File “CMakeLists.txt” in **src/source**.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/OV4xYO1.png" width="650px" />
</p>

The folder **build** will be created in **src/source**. This folder will contain the building files so it can be safely removed in case of rebuilding, it can actually be placed anywhere where the user has writing permissions.
Afterwards, open the Cmake application, a new window will appear:

Paste the **Source** folder path in the textbox labelled as **Where is the source code**, and paste the build folder path into the **Where to build the binaries** textbox. Once the paths are introduced, the **Configure** button should be pressed. A new dialog will appear asking for the compiler to be used in the project. Please, remember that only Visual Studio 2013 and Visual Studio 2015 for 64 bit are supported.

If the configuration succeeds, now press the **Generate** button. This will generate a Visual Studio project file into the **build** directory. 
In order to compile both CPU and GPU versions, just change configuration to **Release** and compile. If the user only wants to compile one version, one can choose one of the solutions **DualSPHysics4.4CPU** or **DualSPHysics4.4** for CPU or GPU versions respectively, and compile it.

The user can freely customize the **src/source/CMakeLists.txt** file to add new source files or any other modifications. For more information about how to edit this file, please, refer to official Cmake documentation ([https://cmake.org/documentation/](https://cmake.org/documentation/)).

**Compile instructions for Linux with Cmake**

The building system needs the following dependencies:
* Cmake version 2.8.10 or higher.
* Nvidia CUDA Toolkit version 4.0 or higher.
* GNU G++ compiler 4.4 version or higher.
* File “CMakeLists.txt” in **src/source**.

The folder **build** will be created in **src/source**. This folder will contain the building files so it can be safely removed in case of rebuilding; it can actually be placed anywhere where the user has writing permissions. To create this folder and run Cmake just type the commands in bold shown below:

```
> cd src/source
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..

```

The command **cmake ..** will search for a Cmake file (**CMakeLists.txt**) in the specified folder. As mentioned before, the user can freely customize this file to add new source files or any other modifications. For more information about how to edit this file, please, refer to Cmake official documentation ([https://cmake.org/documentation/](https://cmake.org/documentation/)).

Once the cmake command runs without error, a Makefile can be found in the **build** folder. To build both CPU and GPU versions of DualSPHysics just type **make**. If the user only needs to build one of the executable files he can use the commands **make DualSPHysics4.4CPU** or **make DualSPHysics4.4** for CPU and GPU versions respectively.
In order to install the compiled binaries into the **bin** folder, the user can either copy the executable files or type the command **make install**.
