Welcome to the DualSPHysics Wiki. Here you will find documentation and information about the project structure, usage, development, etc.

You'll also find examples to better understand how the application works.

## What is DualSPHysics
DualSPHysics is a code based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model SPHysics. It is used next to a series of pre-processing and post-processing tools to create complex geometries and easily analyse numerical results.

## Suggestions and error fixes on the Wiki
If you have suggestions on the wiki (a new section, corrections or contributions) please notify it into the [Issues section of the repository](https://github.com/DualSPHysics/DualSPHysics/issues). Please include something like [WIKI] into the title to help us prioritize the work.

## Errors and missing references on the wiki
This wiki was a translation and compilation of the old PDF guide for DualSPHysics, so it is probable that missing references exists and some errors too. Please, if you encounter any problem use the section [Suggestions and error fixes on the Wiki](#Suggestions-and-error-fixes-on-the-Wiki) to help.
